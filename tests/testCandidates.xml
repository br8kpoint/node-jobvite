Letter of Recommendation- Phil Pearlman Date 4/7/09
To Whom It May Concern,
The intent of this letter is to reflect on Phil Pearlman’s tenure with Eldorado Stone and the contributions he has made to our
success.
It should be pointed out that at the time Phil joined Eldorado Stone, it was in fact, a small business trying to grow into a large
one via a franchise system. Phil Pearlman was in charge of Eldorado Stone’s franchise efforts and set up most of the
successful franchises for the company.
As Eldorado Stone grew it eventually moved away from the franchise model and became a manufacturer selling through a
system of distributors. Again, Phil Pearlman was very instrumental in establishing many of our most successful distributors,
including our current largest account.
As a Sales Manager Phil stands out as an excellent team builder. He takes the time to listen to those in his charge and then
help them develop win-win solutions to the greatest extent possible within the circumstances at hand. He is both mentor and
motivator.
While Phil is a realist and keeps his feet on the ground … he has a special gift for approaching each day with an upbeat
attitude that spreads among his team.
On a personal note … I have told Phil several times that my years working together with him have been the best I have
enjoyed throughout my 30 year career. I mean every word of that.
Phil’s vast range of experience would make him an amazing asset to any company that should choose to employ him.
If you would like to discuss any aspect of Phil’s abilities or qualifications, please feel free to call me directly.
Sincerely,
Dave Gnotta

To Whom It May Concern:  

Re:  Phil Pearlman

I have known Phil Pearlman since 2001 when I-XL opened its first distribution branch in the USA after operating in Canada for over 90 years.  Phil was the Territorial Manager for Eldorado Stone Inc and was the key contact for I-XL with the Eldorado Stone during the start-up of this new U.S. division.  Our decision to enter the US market was predicated, in large part, on the commitments made to I-XL by Phil Pearlman and Eldorado Stone.  As a ‘green field’ start up we were new to the market and the assistance we received from Phil was critical to our success.  Phil helped us with introductions to potential customers, advice on inventory, advice on sales initiatives, staff training, and much more.  With Phil’s assistance we quickly grew into a successful player in the US Pacific Northwest market eventually expanding to three successful U.S. branches with Phil’s direct help.  Phil’s assistance in helping us meet our commitments meant Eldorado could fulfil their commitments to I-XL thus building the most close, trusting, and successful of relationships.

Our success with Eldorado Stone in the US led us to the logical step of offering the line in our Canadian Branches.  Circumstances made the adoption of Eldorado Stone in Canada somewhat of a risk for I-XL.  Phil’s proven record of following through on commitments made to us in the U.S. gave us the comfort to go forward in Canada with great success.  Phil was truly untiring is his support of our efforts through sales blitzes, ramping up the Eldorado end of the supply chain, and simply supporting our efforts in his untiring and positive manner.  Our success is due in very large part to Phil’s input and leadership.              

I would often call upon Phil to seek out his opinion on various topics to assist me in making business decisions.  I trust and respect Phil’s opinions and found his advice always to be sound and of value.      

Phil’s sales, management, and people skills are top drawer as are his instincts.  Phil’s genuine positive approach to everything he does gathers people to him.  I recommend Phil highly.          

Yours truly,

Attention: Rachel Rozenstein – Director of Human Resources
Re: Messianic Telephone Communications / Management

Dear Rachel,

I am very interested in serving in the capacity of Messianic Telephone Communications. I have been a Jewish Messianic Believer since 1987, and I love our Lord Yeshua! I have served as a worship leader of various Messianic Congregations over the years in the US, both on the East and West Coast. Since 1999, I have served as the proprietor of the website, MessianicMusic.com. I assist aspiring Messianic music artists by promoting their musical offerings to believers located world-wide. 

I have attached my resume, which displays years of sales and operations management in other positions as well, which I believe will be an asset to this wonderful cause.

I look forward to hearing from you, and to serving Yeshua in this capacity.

Sincere Blessings in Yeshua,
Phil Pearlman
