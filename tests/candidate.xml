Letter of Recommendation- Phil Pearlman Date 4/7/09
To Whom It May Concern,
The intent of this letter is to reflect on Phil Pearlman’s tenure with Eldorado Stone and the contributions he has made to our
success.
It should be pointed out that at the time Phil joined Eldorado Stone, it was in fact, a small business trying to grow into a large
one via a franchise system. Phil Pearlman was in charge of Eldorado Stone’s franchise efforts and set up most of the
successful franchises for the company.
As Eldorado Stone grew it eventually moved away from the franchise model and became a manufacturer selling through a
system of distributors. Again, Phil Pearlman was very instrumental in establishing many of our most successful distributors,
including our current largest account.
As a Sales Manager Phil stands out as an excellent team builder. He takes the time to listen to those in his charge and then
help them develop win-win solutions to the greatest extent possible within the circumstances at hand. He is both mentor and
motivator.
While Phil is a realist and keeps his feet on the ground … he has a special gift for approaching each day with an upbeat
attitude that spreads among his team.
On a personal note … I have told Phil several times that my years working together with him have been the best I have
enjoyed throughout my 30 year career. I mean every word of that.
Phil’s vast range of experience would make him an amazing asset to any company that should choose to employ him.
If you would like to discuss any aspect of Phil’s abilities or qualifications, please feel free to call me directly.
Sincerely,
Dave Gnotta

To Whom It May Concern:  

Re:  Phil Pearlman

I have known Phil Pearlman since 2001 when I-XL opened its first distribution branch in the USA after operating in Canada for over 90 years.  Phil was the Territorial Manager for Eldorado Stone Inc and was the key contact for I-XL with the Eldorado Stone during the start-up of this new U.S. division.  Our decision to enter the US market was predicated, in large part, on the commitments made to I-XL by Phil Pearlman and Eldorado Stone.  As a ‘green field’ start up we were new to the market and the assistance we received from Phil was critical to our success.  Phil helped us with introductions to potential customers, advice on inventory, advice on sales initiatives, staff training, and much more.  With Phil’s assistance we quickly grew into a successful player in the US Pacific Northwest market eventually expanding to three successful U.S. branches with Phil’s direct help.  Phil’s assistance in helping us meet our commitments meant Eldorado could fulfil their commitments to I-XL thus building the most close, trusting, and successful of relationships.

Our success with Eldorado Stone in the US led us to the logical step of offering the line in our Canadian Branches.  Circumstances made the adoption of Eldorado Stone in Canada somewhat of a risk for I-XL.  Phil’s proven record of following through on commitments made to us in the U.S. gave us the comfort to go forward in Canada with great success.  Phil was truly untiring is his support of our efforts through sales blitzes, ramping up the Eldorado end of the supply chain, and simply supporting our efforts in his untiring and positive manner.  Our success is due in very large part to Phil’s input and leadership.              

I would often call upon Phil to seek out his opinion on various topics to assist me in making business decisions.  I trust and respect Phil’s opinions and found his advice always to be sound and of value.      

Phil’s sales, management, and people skills are top drawer as are his instincts.  Phil’s genuine positive approach to everything he does gathers people to him.  I recommend Phil highly.          

Yours truly,

Attention: Rachel Rozenstein – Director of Human Resources
Re: Messianic Telephone Communications / Management

Dear Rachel,

I am very interested in serving in the capacity of Messianic Telephone Communications. I have been a Jewish Messianic Believer since 1987, and I love our Lord Yeshua! I have served as a worship leader of various Messianic Congregations over the years in the US, both on the East and West Coast. Since 1999, I have served as the proprietor of the website, MessianicMusic.com. I assist aspiring Messianic music artists by promoting their musical offerings to believers located world-wide. 

I have attached my resume, which displays years of sales and operations management in other positions as well, which I believe will be an asset to this wonderful cause.

I look forward to hearing from you, and to serving Yeshua in this capacity.

Sincere Blessings in Yeshua,
Phil Pearlman

To whom it may concern,
In conjunction with my attached resume, I would like to briefly outline my experience and talent.  

I started in the construction business at a very young age due to the fact that my brother-in-law was a general contractor. I’ve had my own remodeling business which gave me a real perspective on how business works. Being an exceptional salesman and manager and a gifted communicator, I found myself enjoying the marketing side of the business more than anything else. 

What I bring to the table, is a life time of success and passion for what I do. I especially excel in teaching and motivating my staff in techniques that were highly successful for me, my employer and the personnel I trained. In each previous job, I increased sales 200% to 500% from start to finish. I am skilled in every aspect of marketing, sales and administration. My strengths include canvassing, shot-gunning, sales, telemarketing (inbound &amp; outbound), customer service, collections, retention, rehashing, lead confirmation and assignment, developing scripts, networking computers and automated dialing systems. I have extensive experience in creative web design and marketing strategies, designing and choreographing infomercials, retail advertising, mass media mailings (layout and design), demographics coordination and implementation, trade shows, fairs and kiosk operations.  I also have been responsible for salary, commission and payroll structuring and implementation.  

I would like more information regarding the company’s current needs and an outline of the responsibilities and compensation for this position. 

Thank you for your time.. I look forward to discussing this with you further.</ns:AttachmentReference><ns:Description>CoverLetter</ns:Description></ns:SupportingMaterials></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"/></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pQKMSfwY</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>New</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">ED01</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Editorial Assistant</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">sLUPsfwG</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>Guy Nesher</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Employee</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eFHLEfwv</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Anna Holton</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Dean</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>(830 837-1662</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:InternetEmailAddress>anna.holton@gmail.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress><ns:PostalAddress><ns:CountryCode>US</ns:CountryCode><ns:PostalCode>78130</ns:PostalCode><ns:Region/><ns:Municipality/><ns:DeliveryAddress><ns:AddressLine/></ns:DeliveryAddress></ns:PostalAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Anna Holton-Dean

I just ran across your job posting on ODesk, and I would love the opportunity to work with anything promoting Israel. I just attended a Night to Honor Israel this week and have been praying heavily for the nation.

This is a tremendous opportunity for believers in Y'Shua.  It is the time of His Story to distribute bibles which more accurately relay the Truth of God.   

That said, I believe that the knowledge and skills required to be successful are an exact fit.  I possess good knowledge on the Messianic, or Hebrew context of the Word, have effective skill in persuasive writing and speech, as well as the practicum of finance to be mindful of resource expenditure.  

Opportunity has allowed me to live and work with many ethnicities, cultures, ages and socio-demographic populations.  I thoroughly enjoy working with all sorts of folks.  Sales experience will allow me to bring discussion to concrete conclusion, to allow for more connections to be made and expansion of the mission.

We have been in ministry full time with Messianic Dance Camps International for the past five years. I am a Jewish Believer for over 20 years. I came to believe in Yeshua by reading the Tanach. When we minister, we share about the importance of helping to support the Jewish Believers in Israel. Unfortunately, we do know some who have given up their faith in Yeshua, and decided to be Jewish unbelievers...It is very disturbing to say the least.
I am rather busy with our little girls as well as with our ministry, but I think I would be able to make it work at least on a part time basis.

Blessings and I look forward to hearing from you.
Mindy Seta

My ultimate goal is to tear down the synagogues of Satan and build up the kingdom of G-D. I live and will die for the Holy One of Israel, who consumes me like a consuming fire. My greatest desire in life is to make the Holy One of Isra'el smile.

I am the anticoagulation clinic supervisor for a local hospital. I adjust patients Coumadin dose based on their current INR. I inform my patients about food and drug interactions with Coumadin. I perform QA for the clinic, monthly. I supervise pharmacy technicians, pharmacists and a nurse practitioner.


Specialties :
Writer, Author, Teacher, Minister,  and Clinical pharmacist

Employment History:

Anticoagulation Clinic Supervisor
Greater Baltimore Medical Center
March 2012 – Present (1 year 2 months)
My clinic is very busy. We see approximately 60 patients per day. I am certified to do Coagchecks (fingersticks to assess a patient's INR). INR is used to determine if a patient is therapeutic on warfarin (Coumadin). Based on a patient's INR value, I determine if he/she needs an adjustment in his/her warfarin dose. Most of my patients are elderly. Many are very depressed and concerned about dying. Being a minister and psychiatric pharmacy specialist helps me greatly to comfort their fears about death and help them with other emotional issues. I minister a lot to my patients. This gives them great comfort. 
I do QA for the clinic monthly to see how we can improve patient care. I supervise two pharmacy technicians, pharmacists and a nurse practitioner. This job is very rewarding because my mother was on warfarin and they could not keep her INR in the therapeutic range. When I can keep a cancer patient's INR therapeutic, I feel like I am giving back to my mom. My mom died of metastatic breast cancer on the Shabbat of 4/16/11. I do this job in honor of my mother and of course, for ELOHIM!

End-time messenger of ADONAI Taz'vot/ Author/Website Owner of “God of Israel End Time Prophecies” www.holyoneofisrael.net.  
July 2009 – Present (3 years 10 months) International
I have been commissioned by the Holy One of Israel, who is God the Father, Son and Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit), to glorify Him and praise His name throughout the nations. The Spirit of the living GOD told me a couple of years ago, "I AM YOUR CREATOR!! MANY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT I AM THEIR CREATOR!!" I could feel the Holy Spirit grieving & fell on my knees in tears. I have made a vow to the God of Israel to proclaim His goodness, majesty, omnipotence & holiness throughout the nations. 
Men have become lovers of themselves instead of GOD!! God wants to have a relationship with us. He wants us to love Him as He loves us. THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND! GOD does not want anyone lost.

In March of 2012, the Ruach HaKodesh aroused me from my sleep and told me to write a book about acharti-hayamim, which means end of days in Judaism & Hebrew. Under the anointing of the Ruach HaKodesh, I completed "Acharit-Hayamim: Doomsday" in three weeks. It was published by Westbow Press in 10/5/12.

In March 2011 the Ruach Hakodesh aroused me from my sleep and said to me three times, "THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE DAY OF THE LORD IS AT HAND!!" Then the Ruach HaKodesh asked me, "and who shall be able to stand?" The Ruach HaKodesh answered, "Those with a pure heart and clean hands, who have not bowed their knees to Ba'al." Next the Ruach HaKodesh told me, "TELL THEM!" I have been telling people ever since. Many may get tired of my voice and my cry, but I must be obedient to the Holy One of Isra'el, who is my everything!

ADONAI Tzva'ot has given me divine wisdom into HIS holy scriptures and has inspired me to share this wisdom with humanity. I created my website: www.holyoneofisrael.net in 7/2009. I am the author of the book "The Holy One of Israel", which was published in 10/2009. I am a Messianic Judaism, end time prophecy and faith expert for SelfGrowth.com. I publish Messianic YouTube videos as I am led by the Ruach HaKodesh.

One night in March 2012, the Ruach HaKodesh (the Holy Spirit) aroused me from sleep and told me to write a book about acharit-hayamim, which means end-times in Hebrew. I am a Messianic Jew. The Ruach HaKodesh has been leading me to scriptures about the acharit-hayamim for many months prior to giving me this message. As always, I did not question the Ruach HaKodesh. I must be obedient to the Holy. Miraculously, I completed this book in three weeks with the guidance of the Ruach HaKodesh. The Ruach HaKodesh was with me the entire time. I give all praise and glory to the Holy One of Isra'el, who is the only true living G-d. Without the Holy One of Isra'el I can do nothing. I am just a worm of a vessel who will return to the dust of the ground. Hallelu-YAH!

I am so excited to hear about the position for Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers. This is a dream come true! I am so in love with the Holy One of Isra'el. He consumes me like an all consuming fire. I live and die for the Holy One of Isra'el.

I have dedicated my life to the Holy One of Isra'el. I have been led by the Ruach HaKodesh to minister to Jewish people who have not accepted Yeshua Ha'Mashiach as their Moshiach promised in the Tanakh. I have an international Internet ministry. 

I am the author of the book, "Acharit-Hayamim: Doomsday," which was published in October 2013.  I am also the author of the book, "The Holy One of Israel," which was published in October 2009. 

I was led by the Ruach HaKodesh to pray on the Temple Mount in January 2013. Chaim Odem, who built the menorah in the Jewish Quarters for the Temple Institute  was my tour guide.

 Listen to this remarkable testimony. I am friends with a believer of Yeshua who lives in Isra'el. I called him when I arrived in Isra'el. He told me that he was led by the Holy Spirit to accompany me on my mission on the Temple Mount. The Ruach HaKodesh told me to pray on the Temple Mount facing the east. I had anxiety knowing which was east of the Temple Mount. Chaim Odem, my tour guide speaks Hebrew. I speak very little Hebrew. However, my Israeli friend speaks fluent Hebrew. He translated everything that Chaim told us in English. One of the first things Chaim Odem  did was point and say, "This is the direction that is east of the Temple Mount. It is the Mount of Olives." Glory! Hallelu-YAH! I knew this was the Ruach HaKodesh. 

My Israeli friend, Reuben Rosenblum and I have a mutual friend in common. This man's name is Ariel Cohen Alloro. Ariel is an Orthodox Jewish priest who lives in Yerushalayim. He is working on  a project called the retrial of Yeshua. My friend Reuben told Ariel about my mission to pray on the Temple Mount. Reuben is one of the lead organizers of this project and wants me to be a witness! I am so humbled and honored. Reuben wants to help me learn Hebrew for preparation of this mission. I can scarcely believe it. What a blessing and honor from HaShem.

You can view about my remarkable journey to the Temple Mount on my Youtube channel. I have 58 Messianic Youtube videos. I am a Messianic Judaism, end time prophecy and faith expert for Selfgrowth.com. I have published nine articles for this website. I have an article entitled, "Messianic Judaism and Eating Kosher," pending publication. I am the owner of the website, The God of Israel and End Time Prophecies. www.holyoneofisrael.net.

Also,  I minster on Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin. My twitter username is HashemmeansGod.

Most of my friends on Facebook are Jewish. Some are Orthodox Jews. The Ruach HaKodesh told me several years ago that HE was sending me as a messenger to the Jew first and than to the Gentile. I am starting to see this manifest itself in my life. I would be greatly humbled and honored to be accepted for this position. I cry at the thought of doing this for the G-d of Isra'el, who I adore, worship and love. 

Todah rabah and bless you for considering me for such an honorable position! Shabbat Shalom!

Erica Karas

Dear Sir or Madam:

Please accept this letter of application for the position of Editorial Assistant in the digital news division at Bibles for Israel. I am confident that my extensive experience in both editing and in online outreach, as well as my strong knowledge of early Christian history and the Jewish roots of Christianity, make me a strong candidate for this position.

I have extensive experience working in digital news. Since May of this year, I have worked as the Social Media &amp; Administrative Associate at OMB Watch, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, DC. In this job, I have drafted and edited reports, analyses, and press releases, copyedited briefs and policy articles, laid out reports using Microsoft Publisher and other publishing software, researched and fact-checked reports, and performed extensive online outreach. In particular, during my six months at OMB Watch, I have increased our number of followers on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter by over two hundred percent. I have also developed relationships with influential bloggers in our field, which have enabled us to reach a much wider audience for our reports, articles, and books. I am confident that this experience would help me to be an effective Editorial Assistant at Bibles for Israel.

I also have extensive experience performing outreach to Christian faith communities. I was a religion major at Swarthmore College, and my coursework included numerous courses about the early Christianity and Judaism. Using my knowledge of religion, I did extensive religious outreach in my role as Crisis Line &amp; Online Media Coordinator at TESSA, a nonprofit devoted to domestic and sexual violence in the city of Colorado Springs. In this job, I organized and developed all outreach programs to churches and faith communities across the state of Colorado. I traveled to churches all through the state to speak on religious issues. Through my outreach and speaking, I helped build bridges between faith communities and secular social service agencies. The minister of one large church in Grand Junction, Colorado, told me that after my presentation to his community, he grew much more aware of resources available for members of his congregations.

I am experienced with Microsoft Office, HTML coding, blog software, resizing and editing photos and images, and numerous social media accounts. I also have extensive experience editing, including editing press releases at my past two jobs, editing a newspaper at Swarthmore College, and working as an academic editor. In addition, I can read Biblical Hebrew, and I have written numerous academic papers about the Jewish roots of early Christianity. One of my papers on this subject received the Jesse H. Holmes prize for the best work of original scholarship in the field of religion. I would come to the role of Editorial Assistant at Bibles for Israel with both knowledge and experience in editing and online outreach, and with an extensive background in the early Christianity.

I have long believed that my long-standing knowledge and interest in early Christianity would lead me to a job working for an organization such as Bibles for Israel, and I am very excited and interested in this position. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions about my application. I appreciate your consideration of my application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,

I am the person you need to hire for this job! 

Please look at my resume and background to see that I am well-qualified to complete your project with excellence, but let me tell you more about myself not in my profile.

I have been teaching the Jewish Roots of Christianity within the local church for five years. I have a passion for Nation of Israel, both the land and the people and am currently writing/editing my own Bible Study to help the common person understand God's plan for Israel. Please look at the following website to see videos of what I teach. The link I'm sending you takes you right to week six, titled "Tending the Fields." 

http://www.thesevenappointmentsofthelord.com/videosbyweek/Week%206.html

It is a 9-week class called "The Seven Appointments of the Lord," and is an in-depth study on the Jewish Roots of Christianity and the 7 Feasts of the Lord in Leviticus.You can open the pdf document to see what the class is all about, as well as lecture videos. Please know this document is currently being edited but is still online because classes are running and participants need to be able to download it. I co-teach this with a friend, so make sure you are watching "Karen" to see who I am (not Becky!). I also do quite a bit of volunteer ministry within the Jewish community here in the Sacramento, California and am well-aquainted with Judaism, both Biblical and Rabbinical. 

My part-time "paid" job was owning and operating an in-home daycare for the past 12+ years; however, my calling and love is for the Jewish people and I have recently closed my daycare to follow God's lead to be available to do what I love and what God has called me to do: write, teach and help others understand the roots of where their faith comes from. 

My background includes a Journalism/Public Relations degree, almost five years of teaching high school English and journalism, many years writing and editing as a contractor, and women's ministry coordinator at our local church. I am currently half-way finished with a Masters in Biblical Studies with and emphasis in Jewish Studies from Western Seminary. My goal with this degree is to continue to write and teach. I am a quick learning, willing and able to learn new skills, am detail-oriented and quite driven (especially in this area). 


Please, please consider me for this position. I am available by phone if you would like to talk and get to know me personally. I am the person you need for this job; I would not only complete is well but have a heart for what you are doing with your ministry.

ashleigh.b1914@gmail.com (email)</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Hello,

To God be the glory!

I was reading through your job posting and I am interested to apply for the said position. I worked for many years in one of the biggest call center company here in the Philippines. I am eager to continue honing my skills and become a more productive and more efficient individual. Currently, I am here in oDesk to take a glimpse of working through my comfort at home yet still prolific.

I started as an agent who handles billing and direct sales then I was promoted as Sales Mentor/Coach. I was in-charged to see the overall sales performance of over 300 agents providing coaching and doing revenue reports. Later then, I was promoted to become a Quality Assurance Supervisor/Specialist III overseeing the entire team in terms of quality related issues for voice and chat supports. My main job is to create initiative to improve calls/call flow, providing excellent customer service, training, evaluating calls, doing coaching to each agent and Team Leaders, doing business review and overall a subject matter expert, reports, data entry/analysis, and project management.

I have proven track of records here in oDesk. As part of my career development, I wanted to be a part of your growing company as Supervisor/Manager. With this said, I am willing to help and share with you my best practices. I am available for an interview anytime convenient for you or as scheduled. I am looking forward to work with you in the near future.

Thank you very much!


Sincerely,

Prepared by:
Leny  Reyes</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Dear Hiring Client :

I am an evangelical baptized- Christian with a great passion and   burden for Christ's Ministry. It is my desire that more lost souls shall get saved and come to His Saving Knowledge and Grace by taking an active role in that Great Commission. Hence this application as Christian Telephone Sales Fund Raising Agent with the pray that I shall be afforded the rare opportunity  to use my talents for His Glory and Honor. Will you please appraise my qualifications?

I am  a computer savvy contractor who joined  oDesk  in October 10, 2010 as a home based contractor. I have been trained for call center jobs and though I did not have that actual experience of performing outbound calling but then I got  2-3 years experience in  local sales and marketing where I have honed both communication and interpersonal skills.

As a computer literate, I can do data entry, typing, email handling and the like with a reasonable assurance of a quality service. My long years of doing accounting  and bookkeeping works has likewise caused me to have that sharp eye for details and made me a highly organized and assertive worker.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

In Christ,


Leny Reyes

Sir:

I am from the Philippines and am very much interested with the job you just posted, ministry telemarketers.  I feel that I am very much qualified for this job and that it is one job that i dream of, to earn and at the same time work for the Kingdom.

Presently, I did not handle any position in our church because I am attending to my 2-year old ministry which is a free pre-school for the poorest among the poor, limited to 12 children only.  Once a week I give their parents an hour per week a Bible lesson to bring them closer to God as it is only God who can change our situations.

I help those pastor who pioneer churches and work as their associate pastor and go back to my church if their churches are already built.

I am a people oriented person and acknowledge organizing people as my gift.  I have small business that supports my family and ministry as I already retired from my work as an English and Journalism teacher where I also advised our school paper.  I love order and want order in my work.

I pray that this application letter be given attention and that I will be hired.  I am willing to be interviewed in your most convenient time.

God bless you and family and your ministry.


in His joy,

Greetings!

I received an email from my Aunt Sheila Cabiles that you are in need of telemarketers. After reading the email, it interests me a lot and immediately applied for the position since my current job will end its contract this October 23, 2012. I am a graduate of BS Hotel and Restaurant Management in Mindanao State University- Marawi. After I graduated, I was not able to pursue working in the Hotel and Restaurant Industry because I was employed in a Call Center Industry in Cebu City. I have worked in that kind of environment for almost six years. Hence, this does not hinder me from applying to this position since I have also a three years experience as an Operations Supervisor handling 15-20 representatives. Aside from handling agents, I was assigned to a variety of duties that included handling practical training of agents, assisting the seniors in their research, preparing discipline guidelines, helping agents to solve their issues assisting the customers. In this way, I have competent knowledge as I have assisted in various agents with different personalities, young and old. In addition to my extensive experience, I have Customer Service (General Skills), Dealing with Others, Flexibility, Oral &amp; Written communication. 

I am currently employed as a Management Trainee in Trendline Center in the Household Department. I am applying to your office since my contract will end this October 23, 2012. As MT, I help the store in managing and motivating a team to increase sales and ensure efficiency; managing stock levels and making key decisions about stock control; and analyzing sales figures and forecasting future sales volumes to maximize profits. I respond to customer complaints and comments. I am also maintaining awareness of market trends in the retail industry, understanding forthcoming customer initiatives and monitoring what local competitors are doing. I believe that my experience would be helpful for you to decide if I am qualified for the position.
I believe that my credentials are capable and efficient enough to stand your mentioned job requirements and so, I kindly request you to consider me for the applied position. Please feel free to call me on the mentioned contact details as per your convenience. 

Thanking You.

Yours Sincerely,

Ministry Director of Operations

Dear Mr. / Ms. Guy Nesher,

I am writing to express my interest in the Call Center Supervisor/Manager position open at the The Messianic Jewish Bible Society, Inc. (Bibles for Israel). I am qualified for the position and I also have a deep passion to serve the Lord. I joined and lead some religious organizations like Christ’s Youth in Action when I was still a student. I am the first born daughter of Leoncio G. Abarquez who is working in Riyadh, KSA and he recommended that I contact you directly about the hiring.

My seven years in the call center industry have given me an overall knowledge of the business and expertise in customer service. I have three years experience of taking both inbound and outbound calls that offer directory assistance, take pizza orders to increase sales and verify business details for 118-118 directory. I also have four years of supervisory experience and handled three different accounts. I helped my recent account which started as a project only to be made permanent by achieving the team goal to process more than one million listings that will be included in 118-118 database in 6 months.

Please take the time to review my resume. I believe that I am an excellent candidate for the position you have advertised, and would very much like the opportunity to discuss with you what I have to offer to The Messianic Jewish Bible Society, Inc. I truly appreciate your consideration.


Sincerely yours,

I received your job opening through Ms. Anna Marie B. Galpo, Assistant to the Head Pastor , Cross Over Ministry. After speaking to her, I realized I meet the demands of the said position, Ms. Anna can vouch that I have the passion for people and that I am competent for this job by God's grace of course.

I had been in the call center industry for more than 2 years now but have taught international students and had my small business in between.

Attached is my resume for your reference. My forte is outbound calls, negotiating with customers and making a sale. I could be placed in your management team or be your telemarketer. I also used to be a short term missionary here in my country and have traveled a lot because of the grace of God.

I claim that you could give me an opportunity for this post.

I came across your listing on Odesk for a telemarketer for your Messianic Bible Project. I was very excited since I was new to Odesk and really had not found anything that had interested me until I came across your posting. I am a 37 year old, Child of God, and home school mom. After teaching public school for almost nine years, I decided that I wanted to use my skills within my home and with my own children. I presently home school two of our three children, and I am seeking a position that will allow me to be flexible.  I am passionately in love with Jesus Christ, and my husband and I both enjoy serving Him through serving people. I am very passionate about the Scripture, and I thoroughly understand how it has been misrepresented throughout many cultures. If I had to think of a position that would most honor God, while also allowing me to use my talents - then this would most certainly be the one. 

I am seeking a position that has flexible hours. I am able to give as many hours as needed to complete a project, but I am hoping to find something that I can work around my schedule and that still allows me to participate in our children's education. I have a quiet space in our home, and I couldn't think of anything better than to dedicate it to a mission that involves spreading the Gospel.

If this is not a commission-based position, then I would appreciate your sincerest consideration. I am truly excited about this opportunity!

My name is Ruby Bracho, a Customer Service Specialist, Telemarketer, Virtual Assistant, and Independent Contractor in ODesk.

I worked in a Call Center being a Customer Service Representative for 5 years.   I was one of the Customer Service Specialist for Cisco Consumer Products, Inc.  Our focus was on North America and Canada clients.  My specialization is to ensure total Customer Satisfaction by providing excellent Customer Service.  I also handled our Email Support Team, comprising of 8 agents. Being the Team Lead, I was able to prove my skills on Team Management, attention and keen to details, and dealing with pressure, meeting up deadlines &amp; goals that are set up.   I was then promoted as a Customer Service specialist.  The Job includes taking in Supervisor &amp; Managerial Calls if client demands of it, and making critical decision  to grant clients' demands as a compensation for a certain inconvenience.  

Being an independent contractor in ODesk, I have been into sales, telemarketing, appointment setting and lead generation.  This is for  real estates, IT products and services, promoting websites and basic internet connection, computer softwares, electricity services, sales training &amp; coaching services, etc.  I have also engaged in doing surveys for certain products, restaurants, and other processes for the purpose of evaluation or gathering information.   I have been a Personal Assistant to a certain firm and have also played the role of a Virtual Assistant, doing all sorts of tasks from taking incoming calls, making cold calls, sending emails,  various internet research works, building database, updating websites, and other administrative  tasks.  
Please check my ODesk Permalink :

My long term experience in the service industry has taught me how to meet and exceed each customers'expectations with a service that sells.  I have assisted all types of customers in all types of settings. I am an excellent trainer who achieves ongoing success with her teams by building morale,  maintaining teams' self confidence and training them to build the sales by improving people skills. I am still looking forward for growth, very much eager to learn and to be trained in any kind of field.  I am willing to be interviewed anytime soon.

Dear Mr. Nesher,

Shalom and greetings in the Name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! I am writing to inform you that I am very much interested in the position in regard to Christian Telephone Sales-Fundraising Agents &amp; Managers that you notified me of in your recent oDesk post. I am conversant with working the phone and I’m delighted at the opportunity to use my skills for the Kingdom of God today and for Eternity! I’m confident that my experience suits me for this position.

As a Telesales Representative, I worked for Physical Therapists dot com. My role was to contact company provided leads - owners of Physical Therapy practices provided on MS Excel which I'd convert to Google docs spreadsheets. I would schedule an appointment to sell them an online patient referral service. Earlier to this position, I worked the phone as a Telemarketing Representative/Appointment Setter with Northbound DGS, I made outbound calls to VP's and Directors of Marketing and Sales for large businesses to attend events along the East Coast of the United States and registering them to attend a sales event organized by Adobe Systems. I used the Salesforce CRM system to contact the potential leads. For each completed call, I would dispatch an e-mail to the Company Executive concerned containing the details and the registration link for the event. Prior to this, I worked as an Outbound Telephone Sales Representative for Careers Connect Services. It is a company that helps people seeking to continue with their education to find schools, colleges or universities that are a match for the field of study they are interested in. I would log into a VCC (Virtual Call Center) and use an automatic dialer CRM-five9 (https://us3.five9.com). With this system, I made outgoing calls to callers who had previously indicated interest in continuing with their education. For each lead, I would make my sales pitch after which I would then conduct a live transfer of the lead to an Academic Adviser for the relevant school of their preference, thereby making a sale. Earlier, I had worked for a computer software company - MB Software &amp; Consulting, Inc. as a Telemarketer and Lead generator. My responsibilities were: calling potential leads (medium sized to large businesses) in Canada and the US across the N.American time zones. I had to identify and contact the company decision maker(s) to introduce to them a new computer server performance enhancing software. I would then set appointments to present them a demo of the Software at work and sell it to them.

I am computer/internet savvy; I have reviewed the requirements for the position and would like to confirm that I meet them all! I am confident that I am well suited for this position and I look forward to working with you soon. Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,

 *Available upon request</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Hi,

I am Terence Gloria. I am interested in this job post.

I was a supervisor for 5 years in a BPO/call center company handled a big account Comcast. I was handling technical support, back office and customer service agents. 

I have the skills, ability, confidence, maturity and commitment to perform well in this role. I have a supervisory position for 5years and I have handled a team in the call center. I have been an agent too and did some calls and chat support. I definitely know how to handle client since that was part of my job. I have been closely working with clients and agents in all my previous positions which has helped me develop positive interpersonal relations and in depth understanding of procedures and business processes. I have a positive work attitude, I like to interact with people especially when there is the need to solve a problem. I am highly self motivated and very teachable. Moreover I am a fast learner and eager to learn new things.

With the many other potential candidates that you’ll be meeting as you continue with your search, there will be certain qualities in them that will definitely stand out.  Some may bowl you over that you can say to yourself that you can end the interview right there and then as you have finally found the best to fill in the job.  But there’ll be no one-size-fits all that will make the best candidate.

But there’s one quality that will make any job candidate stand out.  

It is the passion to unlearn old things so that they can embrace the new, and the passion to learn the new thing so that they can handle the challenges of the new role with confidence.

And I think that sets me apart. 


I give my 101% to any contract, thus, providing any employer ultimate satisfaction. My dedication and passion fuel me to always be outstanding in what I do, be it a short-term stint or a long-term job. When given an opportunity, trust me to deliver more than what is expected and reliability assurance is 100%.

Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Gloria Hollins.  I write to you with the knowledge that your organization is in need of someone with my diverse skills and talents. I come to you armed with career experience in the occupations of food service, care giving, event coordination, housekeeping, hospitality, administrations, and management over a span of 15 years and educational experience in Business Administration.

It is my personal belief that everything is better with a little GLOw in it and I aim to make that 100% true.  There is no job too large or too small and I live to excel and learn.  These qualities and many others are the reason why I’d like to request an interview with someone in a hiring capacity to further discuss my qualifications.

Dear Sir: 
 
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Christian Telephone Ministry 
Professionals position open at The Messianic Jewish Bible Society.  
 
I have a passion to serve the Lord Jesus in the ministry. I have been involved 
in Christian ministries since college in the areas of evangelism, discipleship, 
music, speaking and writing. I can communicate and write very well and I 
have experiences in these fields. At present, my family and me are in the 
community of Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary (APNTS) in 
Taytay, Rizal, Philippines. I am studying Master of Science and Theology 
while my wife is working in the accounting department. Mr. Elmer Gutierrez, 
Business Manager of APNTS, told me about your organization and 
recommended that I contact you directly about this position. 
 
Please take the time to review my resume. I look forward to speaking 
with you about this employment opportunity. Thank you very much for your 
time and I truly appreciate your consideration. 
 
 
Sincerely,

I am very much interested for the home based telemarketing position not because of the pay nor work convenience but what interests me most is the fact that this position is for a Godly cause. 
I am supposed to write about my qualifications, skills, education and industry experiences but my resume bears them all. I opted to tell you about my ministry. I am a faithful member of the Intercessors for the Philippines, an organization of zealous and passionate intercessors from the different evangelical churches in the Philippines. We from the Intercessors for the Philippines employ  worship, warfare and intercession. As we are in the last days, the enemy has changed strategies, as Christians, we must change our strategies too. IFP has been praying for Israel and been consistently declaring Psalms 91 and Zechariah 12 and 13:1&amp;2.
Attached  is my resume  for your perusal.
I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

My name Shirley. I worked as a call center agent for over four years, Conducting inbound and outbound calling. 

At present, I am working from home where I can use Skype for my outbound calling. I have a quiet working environment in my home.

My previous experiences with outbound calling was to ask the prospect if they are interested in getting health insurance quote and then transfer the prospect to one of the licensed agent. I was able to transferred minimum of 5 calls in a day. 
I typically spent 8 hours a day on a telephone.

My inbound account was receiving telephone calls for United Health Care Group and Express Scripts where I typhically dealt with professionals like doctors, providers and pharmacists in the United States. I can say that I am able to build a good rapport with a customer.

I have experience with different campaigns from working from home, usually on sales, for the SEO, Merchant Cash Advance, Roofing, Lead generation Medical Insurance, Virtual assistant for one of the realtor in US. I am expert in Appointment setting with different campaigns and surveys.


Thank you for reviewing my proposal.

Cel. No: 09228281828</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Hi!
I read your job post in Odesk. I'm very interested with the job offer because I'm efficient for the job. I used to work in Convergys as a customer care representative for almost 4 years. I was in an account with billing related concern and was trained for finance representative as well. I'm always up for a multi-tasking job. I have a pleasing personality and very much proactive with work.
I'm a mother of two kids. I'm studying Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering(I'm about to graduate). I used to work in Convergys, Phils, in my field of work we do 
multi- tasking, I was customer care rep tier-3. (Finance, Sales, Technical concerns and likewise for Billing related concerns) I am used to do multi-tasking. 

My edge among the other applicants is that I'm patient, always good in resolving customer's issue and provide customer satisfaction and with a positive goal in life.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks,

PROFILE
 
My passion-driven career has led me to specialize increasingly in the development of English writing and design projects at international levels.  I have experience in: competent research demands; operating within the tight disciplines imposed inside time pressure and demands which I have been trained for years; methodical administration to deadlines and versatile work demands that would require research where layout or writing is a forte; and the application of modern working methods (through hard work and time-management in both decision-making and target-setting, clarity in communication, and easy personal inter-relations).  My own cosmopolitan background and analytical interests in other cultures, together with a command of English and International languages, have also left me confident in handling projects and articles that require the reconciliation of different research approaches to otherwise job demands. 

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Qalanjo.com- Long Beach, California

Successfully managed and coordinated graphic design projects from concept through completion. Collaborated with clients to create vision, conceive designs, and consistently meet deadlines and requirements. Effectively build, motivate, direct design and motivate production teams.

 Key Achievements:

The Lazy Joe Company
Video editor

Created video design, 
Had edited the following video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbsR6zt_KpI

The video is a 36MB mp4 file. No master copy, but the changes made were done without it. here is what we has been done:

1) Changed name from "Dave" to "Alex" (You will notice that the name Dave shows on the side of the character 4 or 5 times throughout the video)

2) Switching the English narration for a Portuguese. The audio file for the voice over is already available, but no sounds available (explosion, phone ringing, people talking, etc). The file I have is for voice only.

3) Some treatment need to be done on the audio file (Portuguese version). Basically noise removal and was made sure it sounded good.

4) The "sounds" were either (explosion, phone ringing, people talking, etc) from the original mp4 file or add new ones, whatever I though easier.

Here’s my finished outcome: URL: http://vimeo.com/27325981
Description: using Adobe Soundbooth, i enhanced sound management and provided spices through sound effects...  ( VIMEO PASSWORD: 1234) video editing was done through Premiere Pro.

TRAINING
 At AVION, we know that as far as our customer is concerned; 
there is only one person in our call center at any one time, and 
that is the one they are talking to. If that representative does not 
possess the knowledge, skills and commitment to qualify our 
clients’ want for their customer; then we have failed that customer, 
thus widening the gap between us and them. That is why we 
focus on the individual’s performance of every single 
representative through intensive knowledge-skill-morale training 
in order to keep our customers at reach and feel at ease 
communicating with us. 
ACHIEVEMENTS
 Our outputs are measured in terms of our clients’ revenues, 
customer satisfaction, and profitability. We focus on the present 
business while keeping an eye on the future. Hence, we 
understand the need to be responsive and proactive. We do not 
wait for opportunities. We develop ourselves to create 
opportunities.
 We are proud to be the first business process outsourcing 
company operating in Northern Philippines. Avion has been in the 
business for 5 years now. You are dealing with professionals who 
are highly trained to do your processes. At Avion, we treat our 
clients' business as if it is our own.
PRICING
 Avion provides you with the best service at a fraction of your cost 
when you do your process in-house. Avion also provides the 
same value compared to the other outsourcing companies at a 
lower price. That's the reason why you can't go wrong with Avion. 
Great value for your money!

Personal Profile

I am a trustworthy and hardworking person who always adopts a flexible and organised approach to work.  I have exceptional people skills, which together with a positive attitude I put to great use in mentoring and developing relationships at any level.  Comfortable working either alone with the minimum supervision, or as a dependable team player, I am also reliable and punctual.  I am committed to continuing my professional development and am willing to undertake any academic or on the job training necessary.  I have been described by past colleagues as good humored, friendly and genuine. I have always had a keen interest in various sports, especially football. I enjoy regular training in weight fitness and circuit classes. I am a born-again Evangelical Christian and attend my local church. I also enjoy sharing the Gospel through evangelism and outreach on the streets on major cities in England.

I was born-again in Christ in early 2008. I will be moving to the Philippines at the end of October 2012 because I will be getting married and starting a new season of my life over there.

I believe I am the best person for this job as Christian Telephone Sales-Fundraising Agents &amp; Managers/Telemarketing because I am a quick thinker especially when it comes to multi-tasking and show great enthusiasm in fundraising. I thrive in pressure situations which brings the very best out of me. I am a fully responsible individual who can handle challenging targets and I am fully trainable to acquire new skills and techniques wherever and whenever necessary.

Because of my previous position as a technical customer service adviser for Apple, it has given me the opportunity to excel in communication, customer care, technical knowledge and troubleshooting, along with meeting tight targets in sales and excellent key performance statistics for producing results that are expected.

I am unemployed at the moment so I can commit to 40 hours full time work. I speak and write perfect English. I have a very competent computer with an excellent high-speed internet connection.

I have a proven track record of telemarketing sales, customer service and lead generation from Business to Business and Business to Consumer campaigns. I am an experienced Call Center Agent and a Supervisor for six years in the call center industry. I am a very proficient, hardworking, reliable individual. I have experienced from the most difficult job such as hard selling campaigns to the easiest like data entry, lead generation, research and surveys. My forte is outbound telemarketing sales and surveys. I give my best in everything I do, I am a very passionate person I put my heart in whatever I do.

I just don’t deliver results, I make sure I excel in what I do which made me a consistent achiever from my previous companies.

I believe I am best suited for this job because I meet all the qualifications you have required most particularly "on fire for Jesus". I am an Evangelical Christian with ministry experiences in our local church. I have been looking for a job that serves my purpose of giving glory to God and doing His ministry works. Also, I am a fast learner, result oriented, a team player and a person with leadership skills. I also work well with minimal supervision.

My experienced here in oDesk and with an Outsourcing Company in Australia was doing offshore telemarketing sales, surveys and lead generation for US and Australian based Companies. Currently, our work contract just ended and so I'm looking for other job opportunities where I can use my skills and abilities to the Company I will be working with.

I believe in your advocacy and I hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you and God bless.

This is in reference to the job you advertised here in oDesk "Telemarketing Agents" and I am very much interested in applying for the post. The main reason why I wanted to apply for such role is because I personally believe that Israel is God's chosen people.  Currently I am supporting missionaries financially and in prayers for Israel through the International Board of Jewish Mission. 

I have had a wide range of experience working with customers in the customer service industry, and I know that with practical, mental knowledge, hands on and communication experience, I would be an asset to your company.

I believe I possess excellent people and communication skills; I also work well independently and in a team environment. Having a background of busy work environments has allowed me to develop my time management skills and fine tune my ability to work well under pressure. I love to work with customers and provide the best service.

I used to work as a Talent Acquisition Representative / Recruitment Coordinator and my major responsibilities would include handling inbound and outbound calls, doing initial interview for  North American, European, and Asian candidates and handling chat support which allows me to interact with the English native speakers on a daily basis. 

Prior to doing online jobs, I used to worked at the corporate setting doing customer service roles (Call Center) which focus mainly on appointment setting, sales, and providing info on the different services the company offers.


If you will also notice on my link, I have worked for a number of CEOs doing virtual assistance roles for more than 5000 hours online.

I am a highly motivated and a career oriented person willing to take on new tasks with one hundred percent commitment. Please see my profile for your perusal. I can be contacted at any stage thru my email (jeanhollyeustacio@gmail.com)  or Skype (hollyc2596) and look forward to hearing from you to further discuss my application in greater detail.

Kind Regards,

Holly

_____________

Top 7 Reasons Why You Need Me In Your Company

1. Proven track record of three (3) years in Freelance Creative Writing in oDesk.com and now transitioning to Web Copywriting through the Accelerated Program for Six Figure Copywriting program and membership from the world's best training center for copywriters – American Writers and Artists, Inc. (AWAIonline.com). Also part of The Barefoot Writer, a training club for travel copywriters.

2. Studied AB Journalism for two years, Dean’s lister, granted certificates for academic excellence and candidate for cum laude, then transferred to an international school, for two more years on double scholarships with Bachelor of Christian Education as my course.

3. Experienced in press work - high school and college organs/student publications as features staff editor, proofreader, researcher, writer, more on news with drama. Enjoyed editing, proofreading and re-writing my schoolmates’ research/term papers for free. Worth mentioning is the fact that I was able to teach my former Cambodian boyfriend how to speak, read, and write in correct English in 2003 and eventually, he became an English teacher in his homeland. Also worked as a Legal Assistant in a local law firm writing court pleadings and notary documents for a year.

4. At 14-17 years old, was elected as Senator for a national youth movement in the country and promoted the organization on TV and print. It is the highest position a young person can attain in that movement. Trained thousands of members and conceptualized, planned, and directed national multi-sectoral youth conferences across the country.

5. At 17 years old, became the Master of Ceremonies (emcee) for the First Lady in Malacanang (our Philippine Whitehouse).

6. Currently serving as a Prayer Minister in Healing Rooms Philippines, Elijah House Philippines, and Wholeness Ministries International, Christian inner healing prayer ministries. Please don't think I am weird. I mentioned this for you to have peace of mind that I am working responsibly, with integrity of heart and skillfulness of hands all the time. I do accept any contract even from non-Christian clients and companies.

7. I have big dreams and visions in life. I desire to join the ranks of the world-class, highest paid copywriting legends. I will finish the 6 Figure in two weeks and will then be stepping into this new craft to sell products and services and promote businesses and companies.

These are just 7 reasons, you will discover more if you contact me RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

As I had mentioned on Odesk, I had done this same type of work for a Company called Infocision Mgt Corp.
I worked for them from 1984-1996 working various fundraising campaigns for The American Center for
Law and Justice and the Right to Life Commitee that was run by Dr. Wanda Franz.  I only left there because

It would be my honor to work with Bibles for Israel.  I have been a born-again Christian since 1971, was raised in a Christian home and attended a Christian school from kindergarten through graduation of high school.  I have a good, solid understanding of the Bible, own several reference works in my home library, including a Jewish New Testament.  I am excited about the prospect of working with Jewish believers in Yeshua.  I attended a messianic congregation for a couple of years and was asked to write an article for publication by the local rabbi.  But, that’s the faith side of my life.

My résumé paints the picture of my experience in editing and proofreading in broad strokes, but I believe you will quickly realize that I have something of value to offer you. While working in healthcare, I had many years of authoring and editing newsletters, sales and marketing materials, technical policy and procedure manuals, employee handbooks, a master's thesis, and several novels.  
 
I work hard and I work quickly. I’m creative, a good problem-solver and detail-oriented. I believe in the importance of communicating with the clients in order to give them the best possible service and outcome.

Zion D. Campo
Applicant</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Your job posting is just amazing. I was part of our Christian organization in our school before. I am also part of a religion forum called faithology.com where we tackled different religious ideas and one of them was Judaism. I am an active member of the forum until now and I have learned a lot from the community. I have built relationships with the people there and have engaged in meaningful conversations.

When it comes to article writing, I am highly proficient at writing engaging and creative articles on a diverse range of topics.I was the associate editor of our school paper and I had a column there that tackled different issues and gave out advice to fellow students.

I am knowledgeable with adobe photoshop so image resizing and anything that has to do with with photos is not a problem with me. I have on page and off page SEO experience as well as knowledge on using MailChimp, Wordpress, Blogger and a little bit of Weebly. I am willing to learn new skills. I can pick up things easily. I am skilled at Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint.

I have experience in managing social media accounts ranging from facebook, twitter, pinterest, reddit and others. I also have video editing skills which would come handy once you decide to use youtube as platform for your services and products.

Availability is no problem with me since I am available for 40 hours per week from 7 am to 11 pm, Monday to Sunday. I also have a skype account for easier communication.

Whew! I think I've said enough. =)

Hopefully, I'd be given a chance to become a part of your digital news division of your Messianic Jewish Ministry.</ns:AttachmentReference><ns:Description>CoverLetter</ns:Description></ns:SupportingMaterials></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"/></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pXHtRfwI</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Rejected</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="jobId">o3MMWfwh</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Sales-Fundraising Agents &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>Elance1</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">ellHDfwK</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Khrystus</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Wallace</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>869-465-9379</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>869-465-2585</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>information@kwforchrist.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Khrystus  V.

Career Objective
I have been running my own translation and editing business for the last several years, serving the academic community as well as businesses and corporations. Previous to that and for several years, I worked as a quality assurance manager and as a consultant for the hi-tech and plastics industries. As quality manager, one of my main functions has been the introduction of ISO requirements to industries ranging upwards in size to 500 employees. I have also worked with companies in the medical industry and have audited GMP practices and prepared for outside audits. The companies that I have worked with have produced the following products: sterilized tubing and drains, sterilization pouches for medical equipment, diamond headed tools, antennas for cellular phones.

              I also have experience in managing the development of a two thousand
              acre banana project in Central America, including packing facilities,
              irrigation, drainage ditches and workers’ housing. In addition, I managed
              a meatpacking plant and cattle and citrus operation.

              Other experience includes teaching at the university level, courses in

I am also working with you now writing for the blog and writing feature articles.

I would be delighted to add phone activity to the work that I am already doing. My hours are extremely flexible (I can call during the day or late at night) and I have years of experience both in sales (10 years selling investments and insurance in the US) and in dealing with the public by phone (both in the US and worldwide). In addition I am completely committed to the creation of a Messianic Bible and would consider the work as a mitzvah (although I do hope to be paid as well -'joke').

Career Objective

Previous to that and for several years, I worked as a quality assurance manager and as a consultant for the hi-tech and plastics industries.

I am applying for the position of Editorial Assistant in your digital news division. I would consider it the honor of a lifetime to be associated with the work of the Messianic Prophecy Bible Project. I am a seasoned writer and editor, deeply committed "Gentile" Christian, and possibly certifiable Bible nerd. Please review my company website for recent samples of my work: http://vbcconsulting.weebly.com/more.html.

I also am able to furnish older work samples and excellent references should you require them. While I currently specialize in producing publications on the computer, my earliest work predates the dominance of Microsoft. Nevertheless, I’m still young enough to be an innovative team player, proficient in all aspects of online journalism. Recent projects have included editing an e-book, setting up a business website, and evaluating a client’s social media prospects. 

Perhaps due to my “advancing maturity”, I understand the historical and biblical significance of the Bibles for Israel project. According to the Hebrew calendar, we have entered 5773, and the days given to men before the earth’s Sabbath rest are winding down. The time is ripe for people of Jewish descent to recognize the Messiah – and I’m awed by the prospect of being a part of it.

Please feel free to contact me by e-mail or phone. My resume is attached.

 Re: Editorial/Digital News Asst. Position
  
Dear Search Committee: 
 
If yet unfulfilled, please consider this my application for the above position.  In 
this cover letter, I will tersely explain my education, experience, and other related data and thus 
why I am professionally appropriate for consideration for this position.  Appended will also be 
the standard resume.
 Concerning formal education, I possess two graduate degrees and an Ivy League 
certificate of leadership which should aptly demonstrate my ability in a high-level environment. 
In fact, I am also an adjunct faculty member of 3 universities/colleges and teach in the areas of 
both Humanities and Leadership.  In humanities, I teach in the areas of Bible and English. 
As to professional experience, I am in my 15th year of work in the area of professional 
leadership of churches and nonprofits. In the area of churches, I was most recently the Senior 
Minister who led the replanting of West Side Christian Church (Denver) into The Pearl 
(replanted 2004).  This required skills in obtaining grant funding as well as initiating both private 
and corporate fund raising ventures.  It has also required 6-figure budget development and 
oversight.  Our organization has moved to an asset-based economic theory and thus proceeded 
accordingly.  Oral and written communication are areas at which I personally excel, having been 
educated in and practicing these professionally for the period mentioned.  I have also been 
involved in marketing and have recently conducted a campaign which flooded the SW quadrant 
of Denver with billboards, direct mailers, newspaper ads, etc.  We drew enough attention that we 
were the subject of a front page Denver Post newspaper story (9/13/04), were featured on the 5 
o’clock news (noticias) of Univision, as well as being featured on a nationally syndicated radio 
station (KLOVE) and receiving further features in national periodicals and websites.  Our 
organization, The Pearl, has been partnering with the Denver Mayor’s office for 2 years in 
pioneering a homeless initiative which is leading other national cities.  Mentoring and personnel 
developing are at the core of my current position, and I have been professionally trained and 
experienced in this for 12 years.
 My church leadership focused on the multi-ethnic urban poor of the Denver community.  
Working with this population has certainly given me a fresh perspective on the human condition 
– into the nature of humanity and the desires which influence the human being, both for good 
and for ill.  It has also demonstrated to me the necessity of networking, relationship 
development, and the value of diversity.  Our organization has been working with both the 
Denver Rescue Mission and the Mayor’s initiative to end homeless for a number of years now, 
and we were featured in Mayor Hickenlooper’s marketing video for this program.
 Why am I interested in this particular position?  I gave my life to the Lord’s service at the 
tender age of 18 and have not looked back. If there is a church in need, it is my duty, and my joy, 
to respond.
 Again, if this position is still open, please consider my abilities for filling it.

 Executive Director: The Tree House Center for Youth, Inc. 
 (1014 N. 5th St. GJ, CO 81501): June 2008-June 2012
 In 4 years, I have been personal involved in tripling the assets held of this 501 (C) 3 
organization through a determined visionary strategy which involved major gifts (real estate 
and securities), new campaign strategies, and online e-strategies including website analytical

as a Daniels Fund Scholarship Referral Agency and has instituted its own scholarship 
program, the annual Bistro community-service scholarship.  Program development,

 In my experience at the position of Exec. Dir., I have directly developed the 
organization’s annual six-figure budget, directed all fundraising efforts (including major

gifts, campaign management, special event coordination, and e-strategies), and handled all 
public relations (including TV and radio spots, social media, newspaper and magazine 
stories).  The Exec. Dir. works hand-in-hand with both a 3rd party accountant’s office to 
prepare monthly and annual financial compilations, and to file IRS 990s as well as managing 
payroll taxes and other financial information including annual audits.  The Exec. Dir. also 
plans Board of Director strategies and manages an organizational staff of 10 personnel. 
Under my tenure, The Tree House has served the largest number of clients in the 
organization’s history:  over 1,000 unduplicated Mesa County youth per year with a total 
program attendance which has topped 10,000.  Aggregate evaluation data as administered by 
OMNI Research demonstrated that our Kids Kabana program successfully improved the Life 
Skills Effectiveness of our youth clients in 4 out of 5 areas during this period.
  
Executive Director: The Pearl (1810 S. Federal Blvd. Denver, CO 80219): 2001-2008  
This position was at a faith-based community organization in inner-city Denver where I led 
a transitioning and re-structuring process which grew the organization’s doubled clientele.  
As the Exec. Dir., I developed the agency’s annual six-figure budget, managed multiple 
staff, executed all administrative duties, and implemented visionary leadership strategies.  I 
was responsible for a six-figure real estate transaction which secured the funding to enable 
the organizational transition to take place.  I also conducted a $50,000 marketing campaign 
which combined direct mail and outdoor marketing strategies utilizing both Viacom 
and Lamar industry resources. The clientele served represented an 85% minority, at-risk 
population.

I am extremely pleased that I have met Edie.  Her extraordinary writing and editing skills would be a benefit to anyone interested in writing or improving their book. Everyone has a story to tell.  Edie can help.</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Dear Mr. Nasher,

Thank you for this opportunity to apply for your invaluable ministry to serve Israel through your Messianic Prophecy Bible distribution efforts.  

I am not sure if I am Jewish yet, but I love the people and God's homeland as if it were my own. In fact, I do claim it as my own because it is the home of all grafted-in Christians. 

I was saved in Israel on my first trip in 2008, which also occurred during the last semester of my writing program at USC. I gave up my secular writing dreams after coming home with a fervent desire to serve God through the skills and education He gifted to me. I started CraftingStones.com for this purpose, but have also been praying for a way to serve God with relation to Israel as a people and a land. 

Assisting the editorial needs of Bibles for Israel would, indeed, be a dream come true. 

Before my trip to Israel, I published a medical guidebook for parents of children with a medical condition called Nystagmus. I would be glad to send you a pdf version so that you can see how I am able to translate complicated issues into easy to understand prose.

I look forward to speaking with you further about this position and how I can be of service.

In His Service,

I am applying for the editorial assistant position. I am a writer and physician from the USA, and I currently live in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

For the last two years I have been working as a freelance writer and blogger. My writing experience is mostly on oDesk where my ratings are excellent (my oDesk URL is https://www.odesk.com/users/~01a0520720639910d8). 

Previously I was considering a position with the Messianic Ministry and communicated with Guy Nesher. Since then I have educated myself on the vision of the organization.

The importance of this work is clearly evident, and I hope to explore where I could be of use to the mission. I look forward to your reply.

Google Searches</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Hello, my name is Lisa Vogel and I am an American-Israeli freelance writer.. I am hard-working and deliver prompt and professional products. I believe I have an excellent combination the knowledge and experience you seek.

For seven years I managed an on-line site for Messianic Jews throughout the world. I have extensive knowledge of Messianic Judaism, The Jewish Roots of Christianity, Judaism and Israel. During my tenure at this website my primary duties were the content creation and promotion of the website. I did graphic design, content writing, blogging, and maintained social media. 

•	I created all the graphics and text for the company’s e-newsletter and e-marketing using iContact and Constant Contact. 

•	I started and maintained the company’s Facebook page. Within six months I took it from no social media presence to more than 1200 regular fans. 

•	One of my primary duties was to create articles about Jewish holidays and life in Israel. These articles were very popular amongst our newsletter subscribers and were a primary factor in growing the company’s subscription list to more than 20,000 members. (Please see my portfolio at https://www.elance.com/s/limavogel/ for examples of articles about Jewish holidays.)

•	I developed the company’s blogs, created the article topic schedule and wrote or edited the posts.

•	All the graphics and photographs on the company’s website were either created by me or under my supervision using PhotoShop.

I also have excellent editing skills and experience. While working with the US Air Force I fact-checked and edited articles and technical specifications about weapons systems in addition to writing these articles. Here, my attention to detail was finely honed. It was essential that these articles were accurate as they served as essential information for troops in the field.

My most current work is freelance. I have been writing a beauty blog for a Dead Sea cosmetics company and editing a pregnancy blog.

I believe that I will be an excellent match for your proposed job. I am new to freelance; however, I have been working as a professional writer in one capacity or another for 10 years. I grew up in the United States and moved to Israel eight years ago. I maintain a residence in the United States and therefore would qualify as a US contractor. 

It is my sincerely hope that you will consider me for your project. If you have any questions about my proposal or qualifications, please do not hesitate to contact me.

To whom it may concern,

	This letter is in reference to the Assistant Editor in Digital Media position. Please consider me as an enthusiastic applicant! 

	I love meeting new people, working in a team, and using my creative talents in all that I do. I am extremely motivated and have great interpersonal skills. I am very interested in a position that requires my education in Middle Eastern studies, a focus upon pro-Israel support and knowledge of world events.  I would love nothing more than to be able to be a part of this team as your new employee. 

	As stated on my enclosed curriculum vitae, my background includes collegiate training in Homeland Security studies focusing specifically on Counter Terrorism as well as a concentration in Middle Eastern Studies in International Relations. I am looking for a challenging position with a professional organization that seeks to show the best of Israel and Messianic movement. Past jobs in customer service and research have given me the opportunity to develop my interpersonal skills in relating information to co-workers and individuals while my M.A. in Counter Terrorism has prepared me in understand the political and ideological tensions in Israel. 
After living in Israel to receive my education, I have decided that my primary occupational goals will be to educate people on life in Israel and to promote a love for the ancient land of the Jewish people.

	Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any additional information. 

	Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.

REFERENCES AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Dear Sir/Madam,

Rabbi Marty Waldman's assistant forwarded me your information about the job opening for an Assistant Editor in your company's Digital News Division, and I would very much like to apply for this job!

I worked at the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute's headquarters in Euless, Texas, for three years (2005-2008). During this time I assisted the International Director, Wayne Wilks, Jr., and in 2007 was promoted to Communications Manager. I gained a lot of experience at MJBI in editing/proofreading materials dealing with Messianic Jewish/Jewish thought and culture. At first I assisted with every newsletter, article, email and web communication, and eventually I became responsible for coordinating, scheduling and proofreading all our printed and online publications. I worked in-depth with Constant Contact and attended every webinar they offered at that time to learn the best practices and strategies for email communications. We had a great communications team, and I was responsible for leading/facilitating team meetings, setting our monthly writing calendar and assigning deadlines within the team to keep everything flowing and on track.

The time I spent at the MJBI was some of the best years of my life. I felt called at a young age to dedicate my life to serving the Jewish people in any way I could, and working for a Messianic ministry was a privilege for me as it allowed me to work in an area about which I felt passionate. I am currently back at the MJBI volunteering and working only as a short-term contractor for the next few weeks, as they are fully staffed and on a tight budget. I would love an opportunity to work full-time for a Messianic ministry again.

Looking at your job requirements and qualifications, I realize my skills would match with some but not all of what you are looking for (yet...I am very willing and eager to learn!). I have the necessary skills/experience with editing articles and working with email software. Part of my duties with MJBI required that I select relevant photos from our own archives and color-enhance/resize them (via a simple editor) for our email newsletters, as well as place them in an appealing layout with the text. We didn't do much with blogging, Facebook or Twitter during the years I was there, but I do have a little familiarity with each one from a business/organization perspective (as well as personal) and have been looking for an opportunity to learn more. I have gained some familiarity with SEO in recent years with an online business, but am still learning in this area. Regarding experience with news and journalism: MJBI's focus was not on world news, but whenever our writers referenced a current event or historical piece or a Scripture, it was my job to fact-check it. I was a guest writer for Jewish Voice Magazine in which I researched/wrote an article on Holocaust Denial. You can view it online here: http://jvmi.convio.net/site/DocServer/Holocaust_-_A_Myth.pdf?docID=1206. JVMI omitted all my endnotes in the magazine due to space requirements, but I can send the original article with endnotes if you would like to see my research. My undergraduate degree was in Business Administration, but English was always my best subject and I was an ESL teacher for a few years.

I am passionate about the Jewish people, Jewish culture, current news events and end-times prophecy as it relates to Israel. I have been a member of Baruch HaShem Messianic Synagogue since January 2007, have taken almost all of their Hebrew classes and have been in charge of their Hebrew Transcription department for 4+ years, in which I manage a team of 4-6 people who put the Parasha into PowerPoint to be projected each week. I have been to Israel twice and have a love, respect and empathetic understanding for the diversity and challenges of today's Messianic culture, as well as an ever-increasing understanding of the challenges which religious and non-religious Jews face in accepting Yeshua as Messiah. I am very familiar with and exposed to a range of believers' practices - from those who on one end of the spectrum mix easily with Christian culture and practice, to those on the other end who desire to live and practice an Orthodox/Conservative lifestyle in order to reach them. Because of my exposure to the latter, I am becoming more and more familiar with the Jewish arguments against Jesus. I mention this because after looking at your website, I wanted to let you know I very much connect with your organization's goal to have better tools with which to help Jewish people find their Messiah.

Thank you so much for your consideration. Please let me know if you have any questions about my skills or experience. I hope to have the opportunity to communicate with you further!

Blessings,

I'm an experienced B2B-B2C telemarketer and a Team/ Proect Manager with profound expertise in this field. I'm fearless, and don't really mind rejections. I've been selling online advertisements in the past, usually dealing with company executives, so I'm sure this is something I can perfectly do.

I have worked as a Social Media Manager for a US-based company in the past, and I'm also a blogger. Been blogging since high school so I'm very well versed with Wordpress and other blogging platforms.

Attached is a voice recording of mine, just to give you an idea how I sound like. 

I've been doing managerial tasks for quite sometime now and I would love to be interviewed in any means you prefer; skype would be perfect. 

Hit me back if you wan to talk. ;)

Hello,
I am applying for a position in which your company has advertised for. Perhaps I am the candidate you are seeking. I am a very well-rounded, loyal, dedicated and hard-working business professional.

The details of your advertisement suggest to me that the position will involve many of the same responsibilities in which I am accustomed to. I have held multiple leadership roles, to include Team Leader, Supervisor, Manager and Director throughout my professional working career; thus, enabling me to be innovative, flexible, tactful, creative, diverse, responsible as well as analytical, and a host of other trained and learned abilities in which I shall use to assist with the growth and continued development of your company’s goals and objectives.

In addition to the many skills and responsibilities in which my resume makes reference to, I also hold a Masters of Science Degree in Marketing; a Bachelors of Science Degree in Business Administration/Management, along with Collegiate Diplomas in Accounting and Project Management, as well. 

Knowing that your company is in the market for the best candidate possible for this position, I pray that you will have to look no further than with me. I most sincerely thank you for your time and consideration of my submission.

Dear Messianic Prophecy Bible Project Officials:

A friend forwarded an email from Rabbi Wolfe, pastor of Beth Messiah in Cincinnati, Ohio, detailing this position. I am very excited to have the opportunity to apply for it.  I feel my education, experience and knowledge of the Bible, Christianity's Jewish roots and what I know about Judaism -- Messianic and Rabbinic -- make me an excellent candidate for the job.

I have more 22 years as a journalist -- serving as a beat journalist for a daily newspaper for 5 years, and 17 years as a freelance writer, editor, copy editor, and public relations professional for the last 17 years.

Joseph Weissman: Executive summary 
Essential Duties
How I meet the specification 
Providing administrative and editorial support to the editor.
I have co-edited the quarterly British Messianic Jewish Aliance (BMJA) Chai magazine since June 2011. In this role I have given editorial support by forward-planning future editions of the magazine together with the editor, and reviewed current drafts and versions of individual articles, and issues of the magazine as a whole.
Copyediting and proofreading articles and briefs. 
I have proof-read articles before they have appeared in print, suggesting changes, and making grammatical and structural alterations as appropriate.
Researching, selecting, color correcting and resizing photos.
I have researched photos and adjusted these accordingly, when submitting articles to the Messianic Times.
Laying out photos and articles in email and blog software.
I have maintained an aesthetically pleasing blog, the Rosh Pina Project (www.roshpinaproject.com) .
Researching and fact-checking stories. 
As a freelance journalist, I have researched and fact-checked stories for a range of publications, including The London Jewish Chronicle, The Messianic Times, The Huffington Post, and the British Church Newspaper. I was the first self-identifying Messianic Jew to write for the London Jewish Chronicle. 
Developing articles and blogs.
I have written numerous articles for my blog Rosh Pina Project, which was featured in a full-page article in the June/July 2010 edition of the Messianic Times, described by the paper’s editor as an “innovative way” to combat anti-missionary prejudice. In addition, I wrote articles on my previous blog Seismic Shock which dealt with Christian anti-Semitism. The story of this blog was featured in BBC News and The Guardian news.
Assisting or managing our Facebook, Twitter, other social Media accounts.

I use Twitter to promote my blog and interact with other users. I have monitored discussions on the British Messianic Jews Facebook group, and also overseen the Yahad Facebook group as a moderator. I am familiar with a range of social networking websites.

Qualifications, Skills and Competencies:

How I meet the specification 
Knowledge of Judaism, Jewish Roots of Christianity, and Israel

I have grown up in a Messianic Jewish home, to two Messianic Jewish parents. I served as a leader of Leeds Messianic Fellowship 2008-2010. I have overseen the Yahad group for young British Messianic Jews since 2005. I have an extensive knowledge of Judaism and Christianity, and I established a Christian Union at my secondary school. I was a member of Jewish and Christian student societies whilst at university. I ha
Undergraduate degree in English, Writing, or Journalism.

I have an undergraduate degree in Spanish Language and Literature, which involved writing at a complex level, in an unfamiliar language. I also hold a Teaching certificate in the UK for Modern Foreign Languages, and I have taught English abroad as a foreign language to school instructors, which required me to demonstrate and to teach very advanced aspects of the English grammar and syntax. I also have a grade A in English Literature at A-Level. My journalistic skills have been praised by editors, and I have secured freelance work whilst maintaining a full-time job as a language teacher. I am also studying a part-time MA in Translation Studies, which involves high-level understanding of syntax in two languages at the same time.
Proficiency with Microsoft Office
I regularly prepare articles on Word, and lesson presentations on PowerPoint. I have also used Excel for school administration whilst working as a teacher, using this aptly.
Strong communication skills, with a good understanding of grammar and punctuation.

I communicate clearly and concisely when writing articles. I have an excellent grammatical knowledge and I use punctuation appropriately. I have demonstrated this throughout my career as a freelance journalist. I have demonstrated my strong communication skills by my successful career as a language teacher. 71% of my pupils achieved a good grade (A*-C) at GCSE level in Spanish, with 29% achieving an outstanding grade (A*-A). 100% of my A-level students have achieved grades A*-C.  I communicated clearly to Spanish citizens whilst working in Spain as an English language assistant. I have successfully taught key grammatical concepts to advanced learners, in both English, Spanish and French. I also studied Biblical Hebrew and Modern Hebrew at university, and I have a solid understanding of Biblical Hebrew.
Demonstrated news judgment, and skill in reporting and writing for the Web and for blogs.

I write for leading British political website Harry’s Place, and I have uncovered stories which have broken as international news. For example, I was first to report a scandal about Wikileaks, and their associations with the Belarussian regime, which featured later on a BBC documentary. I also broke the news first that the British anti-Semite Gilad Atzmon had found support in American political professor John Mearsheimer, of the University of Chicago. The story was reported globally. On the strength of my writings for Harry’s Place, I was invited to write for The Huffington Post as a blogger, upon their UK launch. In addition I have maintained my blogs Seismic Shock and the Rosh Pina Project.
Demonstrated skill in all aspects of online journalism – reporting, writing, editing, photography and social media.

Please see above.
Demonstrated understanding social media concepts and blogging best practices.

Since June 2009, the Rosh Pina Project blog has generated over 635,000 individual views, averaging 200,000 blog views per year, and 16,000 blog views per month, which works out as over 500 blog views per day. I have used Twitter and Ping-backs to promote the blog, as well as cross-posting articles on other popular websites, and instigating dialogue with other blog users to advance my blog. I used Search Engine Optimisation by using tags and pingbacks to enhance Google and Bing search results, and push my blogs higher up the search engines.
Willingness to innovate and learn new skills.

I am highly motivated and frequently willing to find new ways to succeed professionally. I enjoy learning new languages, and have been teaching myself Italian for the past six years. I would like to learn more and more skills.
Experience working in a highly collaborative environment where all team members are invited to provide input to major decisions.

As a languages teacher, I have collaborated with colleagues to develop schemes of work and to build learning support materials, and review, analyse and improve departmental policies.

Experience: I have much experience with blog software using both Wordpress and Blogspot, as well as using Search Engine Optimisation to improve my blog statistics. My blog is currently one of the most popular Messianic blogs on the internet, and is also used as a news source by Israel Today. I learn new skills quickly, and can become very proficient with email and photo resizing software within a short space of time.</ns:AttachmentReference><ns:Description>CoverLetter</ns:Description></ns:SupportingMaterials></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"/></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pUIFSfwT</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Rejected - No Email Sent</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">ED01</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Editorial Assistant</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">sLUPsfwG</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>Guy Nesher</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Employee</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">erxFEfw1</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Krisette</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Capati</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>639173906777</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>krisettecapati@yahoo.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Krisette Capati

Involvement for a local church community volunteer = from various periods of 1993 to 1998


SKILLS &amp; EMPLOYMENT RECORD:

Based in the Philippines, I finished a Computer Programming course from one of AMA Computer Learning Center’s campuses, and have six years working experience as a call center agent from various accounts as a sales representative, technical support agent, and formidably as a Customer Sales agent for banking accounts and customer account holder relations among other employments within computer shops, and as a Baranggay (Community) Hall staff volunteer prior to these previous employments as a Call Center agent.

After graduating high school, I have taken 2 Terms of Bible Study courses at Emmaus Bible Camp at Mabolo, Malolos Bulacan under the direction of RBC’s David T. Harvey, as part of a church volunteer/layman staff on a community church in our neighbourhood, from 1993 to 1998, The Novaliches Christian Fellowship, which is under the umbrella of the Bretheren churches in the Philippines who’s main congregation is at San Juan Gospel Chapel under Ptr. Rudy Ponce De Leon.

After my involvement with the said congregation, I become affiliated with other congregations such as Messiah Baptist Church (Fundamental Baptist); Foundation Of Truth (under pastor Ferdie Ramos); Victory Christian; and lastly for several months I have attended Cathedral Of Praise (branch at Shangri-La Mall Plaza) and was a part of a connect group from their roster. [continued (next page)]
To volunteer under service of God’s ministry is something that I fully understand to have some great baring not only for the responsibility associated with the work, but with also regards to accountability as well. Having saturated to as much as I could afford on studying God’s Word, along within those personal studies I have also looked into the varied views and perspectives of other churches’ doctrines, and from other religions and sects;  besides the experience of meeting and getting acquainted with people from various walks of life amidst the many situations encountered which garner lessons. In no way of being pretentious, to heed the call of the Lord into any opportunity to function within the ministry is an area where one should not be amiss, and therefore seeing the opportunity allotted, I hereby submit this formal application. Thanks and best regards.

Hello,

As stated above, I have 
8 years of working as an agent in the call center industry,

I'm based and raised here in Manila Philippines, I am now 40 years old.
I first came to submit myself to the Lord Yehoshua Jesus on a day I vividly remember back in the 17th of March, 1985 when I'm just about entering my teens. Besides and prior to working on the call center industry, apart from a certain number of odd jobs as volunteer for minor government service and staff-clerk on shops - I have a good experience of working as an official/non-official volunteer for a church ministry, I also have a good learning of the Scriptures through personal studies,and some semi-formal Bible Schooling and various conferences I have attended.

Granted from working in the call center industry, besides the work oriented challenges and occasional stress related to the job, are the level of difficulty of being in the secular world with its surrounding as a christian, that i have been praying all along for a better job opportunity - either in or out of the Contact Center industry, therefore having found through reference of my former boss on one of the contact center companies I have worked for -- it is apparent that this job opportunity within your company is just about the perfect one for me as a place where I could commit my time and compliance for employment in the Call Center market.
Thank you so for the consideration of my application. All the best wishes to your company from on High .
Best regards, and God bless us all.

Sincerely,

Christopher Lim (Forrester)

John Fleming has spent a career in commercial printing and graphic art. The son of a printer, John began his learning apprenticeship in the family business.  His learning began in the letterpress department, and included years spent in composition, bindery and press operation. 

After entering the U.S. Army at age seventeen, John went to Defense Information School for advanced training, where he completed a multi-discipline military journalism course. After graduation, John was added to the staff of the school. For a year and a half, he operated the printing shop that prepared course materials and printed orders for graduated students. During this period of time, he was promoted to E-5 (non-commissioned officer).  Following this tour he was sent to Korea, where he used his journalism skills while working at he brigade-level newspaper published by the 38th Artillery Brigade.

After working for three commercial printers in the southern California area, John moved to seaside Ventura county in the 1980s, where he opened and operated Vintage Press, a commercial book printing company. After more than twenty years as owner/operator, John closed his shop and retired to the central coast area. His time is largely filled with reading and studying... religious and secular history are favorite subjects. His love for writing has continued to bring satisfaction.

John would enjoy using his printing and publishing experience to further a worthwhile cause. Compensation is secondary in consideration, the most important aspects of a position with your organization would involve the extent to which he can be of effective service.</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Shalom,
My Rabbi Mitch Rosen forwarded me your job description/application. In his opinion and mine, this position may be ideal for me.
I am a semi-retired business owner, looking for a good use for my time. I have spent my career in the printing and publishing industry...  but my love is writing.
When I was a young man, I attended Defense information School at Ft. Benj. Harrison.  This school is a joint command institution for all services in the U.S. military -- army, navy, marine and air forces all send pupils to learn hard journalism and broadcast skill. The class was quite comprehensive, including news writing, photography and print publication. I enjoyed working in these areas, and have used some of these skills in my civilian work.
I founded and operated a printing company for twenty three years in southern California. My company specialized in book publication, but ran all manner of commercial print; viz, stationery, forms and posters. It was during this period that offset printing (I am also a letterpress expert) changed from "copy ready" artwork to digital assembly.  During the time I operated my shop, I employed several employees to operate the assembly process...  using Adobe software such as: Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. In the last several years I have learned this software personally.
I am a gentile, but my heart is with Israel. For a little over two years, I have been attending a messianic congregation in Arroyo Grande in central California where I now reside. I would love to put the skills I have developed over a lifetime to work to support the G-d given work of spreading Gospel.
If you are interested in further exploring our mutual needs and expectations, please feel free to contact me by phone or email at any time.</ns:AttachmentReference><ns:Description>CoverLetter</ns:Description></ns:SupportingMaterials></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"/></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pdwKSfw5</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Rejected</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="jobId">o3MMWfwh</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Sales-Fundraising Agents &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>MB_Job_Page</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eCZKEfwJ</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Raylynn D.</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>DIOQUINO</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>09277823991</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>09277823991</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>RAEJ_PAS@YAHOO.COM</ns:InternetEmailAddress><ns:PostalAddress><ns:CountryCode>US</ns:CountryCode><ns:PostalCode/><ns:Region/><ns:Municipality/><ns:DeliveryAddress><ns:AddressLine>22 BLK 2 KENMORE HOMES HABAY I</ns:AddressLine></ns:DeliveryAddress></ns:PostalAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>LOT 22 BLK 2 KENMORE HOMES HABAY I • BACOOR, CAVITE

The Human Resources Manager 

   Dear Sir/ Madame: 

   Warm Greetings!

I am writing in response to an online ad that your prestigious organization is in need of Human Resources Assistant. It is really my privilege to be considered in the said position and be hired. I would be glad to meet you so that you can clearly evaluate how my abilities and skills fit your needs.  
In lieu with this, my competencies and experiences with human resources and recruitment in handling / managing people for 5 years were of immense help to my adeptness in performing well with the job. I had been doing excellently and did exemplary job in my current employer (Philip Morris International). I had also been exposed in all aspects of Human Resources in Stream Global Services and Aerophone that shaped me to build great relationship with people of different personalities and demonstrated a high standard of professionalism and efficiency with my job.
You can definitely contact me through the phone number indicated on my résumé and I am very willing to be interviewed at your convenience. Thank you. 


Respectfully Yours, 


Rugero John T. del Mar

Because I have spent a lifetime working "on the front lines" in food service, hospitality, and retail, I don't speak jargon, I speak plain English (and a tiny bit of French).

Thank you for the opportunity to bid on this project.

As a journalist for my local newspaper company, I write on varied subjects, from local government to events, both religious and secular. Please see a small portfolio of my work at http://bobperyea.contently.com.

My wife is a photojournalist and freelancer photographer. For years, I have been editing and correcting photos for her. I have Photoshop Elements, Microsoft Digital Image Editor and PhotoScape in my possession.

I am a Christian who grew up in New Jersey with many Jewish friends, so I have an understanding of Judaism and its amazing traditions. I have also made a personal study of Judeo-Christian religious history. I have a layman's understanding of the Jewish roots of Christianity.

As a blogger, I have increased the readership of one of the blogs I operate by 800% in one year. 

I guarantee my work. If you don't use it, you don't pay for it.

Email programs, social media and blog platforms are all skills that I feel very confident in. SEO and internet writing is a skill that I have honed to near-perfection over the past several years.

It is my belief that spreading a positive message of faith as far and wide as possible is the key to a peaceful, love-filled world and I think that your project might be an opportunity to do precisely that.

I look forward to working with and wish you all the best with your new project.

Sincerely yours,

Writing is more than a few grammatically correct words on copy. To write is to communicate and to communicate is to engage. Writing is my craft and engaging is my passion. Somewhere between the two sits the whole array of words and the power they possess.

Stringer, Associated Press; published in The New York Times</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Good morning:

If you can't find one person to do all of "those things," I'd be delighted to copy edit and proofread your articles and briefs.

I have the knowledge of Judaism you seek, plus my editing credentials are impeccable.

TEN YEARS as a writer and editor of IBM executive communications, internal communications, and marketing communications, makes me an ideal match as your copy editor. I'd love to do that aspect of the job.

At IBM, I was often the last set of eyes to "polish" a document before it went to press, so my proofreading skills are among the best in the industry. Having been a superstar at IBM, I understand the meaning of "flawless."

I am now the teacher of writing at an award-winning middle school in Ridgefield, Connecticut, and because of my position, I choose my assignments carefully. I would deliver your edited content promptly and with pride.

Given my track record (resume available upon request), I assure you extraordinary content, and 100% satisfaction in these areas:

* Spelling
* Grammar
* Syntax
* Tense Agreement
* Consistency
* Punctuation
* Capitalization
* Typos &amp; Misnomers

Golda Rosen
Senior Editor
Bibles for Israel
 
Dear Ms. Rosen:
 
I wish to submit my application for the position of assistant editor in your on-line news department.  I heard about this through an announcement at Beit Chesed in St. Louis, a congregation pastored by Jake Rosen.  My wife and I attend regularly and have attended Jake's ministry off and on since we met there in 1986.  She is a Jewish believer.  I was excited to hear about the position with your organization because I think it would be for me a gift above what I could have asked or thought to work in the area of my greatest interest using what I believe is my best skill and talent, which is writing the English language correctly and clearly. Nothing interests me as much as the subject of the signs of our Lord's immanent return, namely the fulfillment of Biblical prophecies by current political, cultural, ecological and international events and trends. Really almost nothing in this world interests me at all unless it relates to this and the preparation and positioning of Israel for its prophecied role in end time events and also the friendship of my own country, the U.S.A., with Israel, which I consider a mark of God's special favor upon it concerning which I am presently much discouraged.  Lately I have been doing an in depth study of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.  If I live long enough I intend to include all the "minor" prophets as well. 
 
I am a life long news junkie.  My major subject of interest since childhood has been history. I wrote my high school thesis on Islam. I studied Western and Eastern Civ at Washington University in St. Louis.  I have read most of Will Durant and a lot more.  I feel that this gives me a sense of perspective about the world which most people lack.
 
The second church I attended as a saved person was a black messianic congregation where I feel that I encountered the God of Israel in a profound way and where I was inculcated with the belief that the Jewish people are the apple of God's eye.
 
I am a graduate of Washington Bible College in Lanham Maryland which taught steadfastly that every word of scripture is God breathed and that the Old Testament prophecies concerning Israel are to be taken literally and as belonging to the future, destined to be completely fulfilled upon and for the Jewish people, the natural descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In bible college I wanted to be a missionary to either Jewish or Muslim people.  I went on a missions trip to New York City with the American Board of Missions to the Jews, now called the Friends of Israel.  I regret that I did not fulfill that ambition but, since you are an organization which has a primary purpose of evangelizing the Jewish people by the demonstration that Yahshua is the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy, I would recommend myself to you by saying that I am sure my major spiritual gift is evangelism and that I try to seize every opportunity to give the gospel to lost or possibly lost people I meet.  This takes the form of constant street evangelism and witnessing to strangers or acquaintances whenever the moment seems favorable. I believe that nothing is more important than rescuing a human being from eternal torment and introducing him or her to everlasting blessing in Jesus Christ.
 
As for my skills, I have no editorial experience as such.  But I would argue that in a sense I have something perhaps even better.  I feel that I was in a sense born and bred with literary gifting.  I am obsessive about clear, grammatically correct, elegant English.  I consider it the indispensable mark of education and civilization.  I had parents who were great snobs about speech and constantly taught and corrected their children in this area. I attended a secondary school which was taught by Oxford educated English monks who made a great impression on me and whom I tried and try to emulate.  To this I would add about 18 years working as an investigator for a very precise, exacting lawyer, who is himself a brilliiant brief writer.  I was for years required to rewrite reports up to four times to satisfy his demands for brevity and precision.
 
 I will provide samples of my writing if you so desire.  
 
In conclusion II hope you will consider me for the position of assistant editor.
 
Thank you for your time and attention.
 
Very truly yours, in Christ.

This Shabbat, I was in the office of Rabbi Jeremy Storch, of The Tabernacle of Praise, in Branson, Missouri.  After seeing a book I recently illustrated for our dance leader/play writer Deborah Martin called "Chanukah Night Life,"  Rabbi asked me to design a cover for his Booklet of Shabbat Blessings and Torah Liturgy. While in his office, he mentioned that he had received an email about a position that he felt might be perfect for me.  I asked him to forward it to me and indeed I am very interested in the position.  

As you said, this job will be a blessing to me in the Messianic community and I very much appreciate the Rabbi forwarding this ministry job position on to me.  I love to spend time researching current Israel and world news and the Parsha readings.  I had spoken to our Shabbat school teachers about perhaps designing more color sheets to go with the Parsha readings discerning that ADONAI would like to use me more and more in the ministry.

With my graphic, writing and research skills, plus a willing attitude to collaborate and learn new skills, I believe as an editorial assistant, I could be a blessing to you as well.  I am very excited to be of any assistant.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

The Messianic Prophecy Bible Project
Re: Editorial/Digital News Assistant with Bible for Israel

Please accept this letter and resume as my application for the full time, work from home Editorial/Digital News Assistant at Bibles for Israel. I wept as I read the testimonies on your website. I want to be involved in lovingly pointing Jewish people to their Messiah!
Several experiences in my life led me to Baruch Haba Messianic Jewish Synagogue.  Reading through the Tenach, I wanted to understand the culture in which it was written. I have wanted to go to Israel since seeing the Billy Graham film His Land. My father gave me a poster by a Messianic Jewish artist. Attending a Jewish Roots of our Christian Faith course and a series of lectures on the Feasts of the Lord prompted me to seek and find a local Messianic congregation. I have been part of Baruch Haba Messianic Jewish Synagogue for more than five years.  Our congregational leader George Geesey encouraged me to apply for this position.

At Crown College, knowing the original languages would help me better understand the Scriptures, I studied Greek, since Hebrew was not offered. I have also attended Hebrew classes in conjunction with Baruch Haba until my work schedule interfered.

In one of my current positions I am working as an Editorial Assistant for Finishing Line Press. In high school journalism I was assistant editor of the school newspaper. The principles I learned come to mind when I need them. I have undergraduate degrees in missions and elementary education. My Master’s degree is in social work. At Crown College I wrote many research papers, most of them related to Scripture and/or religious themes. An inborn propensity toward good grammar and punctuation appears to persist to this day.

I had a blog for about two years. Finances forced me to give it up. I still have some of the articles I posted, I and would be glad to share with you. Also, I created a website, which is no longer. You desire a candidate with skills in social media. I have not been active in social media; however, I am willing to learn what you require. And I am certain I will readily transfer learned skills from one venue to another.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. My mobile phone is 859 967 7162. Email is mbaxter1973@yahoo.com.

Sincerely,

RE: Editorial/Digital News Assistant, Kehilat Ariel Bulletin, 11/03/2012

Dear Bibles for Israel,

I’m contacting you in regards to the Editorial/Digital News Assistant position at Bibles for Israel, which I saw advertised in the bulletin at Kehilat Ariel Messianic Synagogue on 11/03/2012. I am very interested in learning more about this position, and believe I am an ideal candidate. 

I grew up In the Messianic Jewish movement and have been attending Kehilat Ariel in San Diego for the past 20 years. I also have extensive knowledge of Judaism from my undergraduate work in Judaic Studies, which I completed at UCSD in 2006. I love to follow the news in Israel through sources like Arutz Sheva and the IBA News. I also have an Associates degree in English, as creative writing is another passion of mine. I have a strong desire to be a journalist on middle east affairs as well as become a Messianic rabbi of my own congregation in Israel at some point in the future, and believe this a great opportunity to move in that direction. 

In my last position as an administrative assistant at Faith Financial Advisors I helped proof read the majority of our financial advisor’s correspondence with his clients and business contacts. I also helped him resize and format logos for his letter head and newsletters. There was also many times where I had to do research in order to meet our financial advisors needs while he focused on making sales. 

In addition to my administrative skills I am also very familiar with social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace, and enjoy blogging about what is going on Israel, and on concepts in Judaism. I am excited about the possibility of learning new skills, and I am more than willing to be innovative if chosen for this position. I also have 2 years of experience working in a highly collaborative environment when I was on the Union of Messianic Jewish Congregation’s Twenties Committee, where I helped organize and run conferences for those in their 20’s in the south west region.

I believe with my skill set and experience I can be a valuable part of your team. Thank you for your time and for considering me for this amazing opportunity.

Shalom in Messiah,

Alan Savarese

CHARACTER REFERENCE
Available upon request.</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Dear Sir/Madam:

Greetings of Peace!

I have read from an online jobsite that you are looking for an editorial assistant. I am interested to apply for the position and be part of your institution. 

With regards to my career in writing and editing, I am currently an Assistant Editor for Social Studies at one of the leading publishing companies in our country. I had been an outsource Social Studies textbook editor for an independent publishing house. I have worked as a part-time freelance editorial assistant in the English Department as well. I did all facets of editing, copy reading, proofreading, and physical evaluation of textbooks and the teacher’s manual as well.   I have been accepted as a fellow to a national writing workshop where I had the privileged to learn and have my works evaluated by a pool of established writers (Palanca winners and a few National Artists.) 

I have won literary awards for my works and the sponsor (contest organizer) published it in a folio.  In addition, I have been part of the editorial board of various publications in our parish.  Furthermore, I had been a part of a special project that worked on a text book and teacher’s manual for Economics.  Lastly, I have lots of exposure doing research writing as an MA student.

I have presented a paper for a national conference as a finalist for the 2010 Salita ng Taon at the University of the Philippines. I also won a special complimentary prize for the First Blogging Contest on Technology last May.  One of my articles was accepted and published in the 4th UP Likhaan Journal.  My flash fiction story has been chosen for publication under DLSU Press and Anvil Publishing as part of its 100th anniversary. My Social Studies textbook will also be out this 2012.

I am a Cum Laude graduate from the University of Santo Tomas where I took a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education major in History and minor in Religious Education and School Guidance. Currently, I am finishing my Masteral thesis at De La Salle University.  Furthermore, I am a passer of the Licensure Board Exam for Teachers with a rating of 81.20% as well as a Civil Service eligible.  

I believe that my extensive and varied background, combined with my professional experience, education as well as my personal skills, and interests could be very valuable to your company.  I am a hardworking individual and I enjoy challenging work which requires detail and organization.  Likewise, I am dynamic and creative as well as resourceful.  I believe that these are some essential qualities that an editorial assistant must possess.  

I love writing and value printed materials (Ex. textbook) because I see it as a tool to teach minds.  I also believe that through writing, the author can touch the hearts and transform lives of individuals.

Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my qualification and candidature.  I am enclosing my curriculum vitae and sample writing for your review.  If you find that I qualify for the position, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my experiences and qualifications.  

Respectfully yours,

Ms. Christine Marie Lim Magpile

Courses Taught:

Bible & Spiritual Formation
Equipping to interpret and apply the Bible in accurate and dynamic ways for spiritual transformation and character formation.

Introduction to Philosophy
A general introduction to the nature, problems, methods, concepts, and divisions of philosophy.

Moral Philosophy
Moral philosophy is the pursuit of ‘goodness’ in both word and deed. It therefore deals with questions of ‘what ought to be’, ‘what ought not to be’, and the concepts of ‘right’, ‘wrong’, ‘good’, and ‘evil’. This class focuses more specifically on what it takes to become a good person. During the course we will (a) refine our understanding of “the good life”, (b) explore the traditional virtues associated with Aristotle’s “great-souled man” and Plato’s “well-ordered soul,” and (c) trace some of the development of the good life and the virtues in later writers

Biblical Backgrounds
Few books have had as much influence on great literature and major shifts in history as the Bible. Familiarity, therefore, with its main figures and theological frameworks is essential if one is to understand history, literature, and the world. In this class we will (a) demonstrate how the regions within which events took place better inform our understanding of its narratives, (b) gain an appreciation for its various literary genres, and (c) study some of the main contours it puts forward on the relationship between man, God, and the world.

British Literature
Our language has a rich literary history which we will explore through British plays, novels, and poetry. We will seek primarily to understand the philosophical and moral themes in the writing of such masters as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dickens, while allowing well-reasoned analysis to serve us in the evaluation of our own philosophical and moral viewpoints. We will learn to read sensitively and analytically, turning to the texts themselves to foster meaningful discussion.

I would like to find out more about this position. I have extensive background and knowledge of Jewish roots of Christianity / New Testament. I am an associate member of the Jerusalem School. I have a PhD in Theology from Loyola University in Chicago. One of my main research interests is on the relationship between the shema of Deuteronomy 6:4-5 and Trinitarian theology. I realize you may be looking for someone with less qualifications for a position like this, but—depending on the nature of the work—this could be a valuable opportunity for me and my family as it would allow me to work from home.

Thank you for considering me! I'm Zach Sullivan, German and Hebrew linguist, music teacher, and computer guy. I'm on Twitter @XakSullivan. I am passionate about learning Hebrew and studying the Bible and yearn to go to Israel &amp; I am excited about the anointing and calling which God has place upon my life. I love him.

I am thankful that we are on the same team and that you are working on spreading the gospel to the lost sheep. Not only can I do telemarketing, but I have valuable skills with internet marketing, SEO, SMM, and am a strategic and frequent user of Twitter, the tool which Israel just used today to announce it's attack on Gaza, and the tool Barack Obama used to gain a foothold to help him win the election. Technology today is more valuable and powerful than most people realize.

I have sales experience, tho most of my experience is in teaching. I have taught at the University of Alabama, as well as the University of Alabama at Birmingham, as well as Baldwin Magnet School and LAMP (Loveless Academic Magnet Program). These last two were voted the best middle school in Alabama I think, and the 16th best public high school in the nation.

I only feel right about selling something in which I believe. I am interested in your project. I believe in the Bible from Genesis through Revelation and don't believe in working on Shabbat. Please let me know within the coming week if you are interested in collaborating with me, or as soon as possible at least. 

I found out about the position via Mandie Greenberg so any referral bonus should go to her.
. 
Blessings,
Zach

Education

Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology, Minor in Sociology  
University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>What attracted my interest about this job posting is that you are looking for agents who are on fire for the Lord who have telemarketing expertise. I meet this very description. I have been born again since 2006 and the Lord has radically changed my life. So any opportunity to establish a Kingdom presence is something that interests me, especially in the messianic area as that is the foundation of the Christian faith (I even visited Israel in 2011).

I am very familiar with telemarketing. The bulk of my experience was working as an admissions advisor for 1.5 years making an average of 75 calls a day to prospective students for the purpose of enrollment. The majority of my work experience has been in affiliate management which includes telemarketing efforts to recruit publishers in addition to daily calls to maintain relationships with the current publisher base.

I also have experience in the business development arena. Having been successful in all the above areas, I am also a quick learner and a team player.
Let me know if you can get on a call so we can further discuss the possibility of working together as I am very interested in hearing more about your company. Either way, I look forward to hopefully working with you at some point in the future.

Bibles for Israel
Editorial Assistant
The Messianic Jewish Bible Society
P.O. Box 8900
Pueblo, CO 81008-8900

Dear Mr. Ros,

I praise God that I happened to be browsing some freelancing job opportunities only to stumble upon your ad seeking an editorial assistant. I carefully read through the requirements and realized that I did not meet all of them to the jot and tittle; howbeit, I am zealous for this opportunity and want to share what I can offer.

I am an avid reader, researcher, and historian as I am graduating with a Bachelors of Arts degree in History in the next couple months from American Public University. My areas of specialty and interest include, but are not limited to, American history, the age of enlightenment, and ancient Near-East cultures, including ancient Israeli and Judean history. On top of that, I am also an essayist, freelancer, pamphleteer, journal and article writer. I am proficient in topics such as current events, the geo-political climate, philosophy, prophesy, conspiracy and more. As I have implied, I am a young adult male, who is passionate for Yeshua and His Word. I am engrossed in studying the Bible, prophesy, and etymology and have held scores of unique positions within the church such as leading worship for youth group for five years, leading vacation bible school music for five years, and starting an intimate Bible study last summer for college-aged believers called Ekklesia Bible Study.

Further, I would like to outline some of the skills I possess and how I can meet the requirements that are being requested of the future position. On top of being a adept reader, writer, and researcher, I also am proficient at photo editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop CS and more. I am enthusiastic, optimistic, and encouraging. I can proof read and provide a unique straight-forward informative, yet eloquent, prose. Being a historian by nature, I am skillful in source and fact checking information. I am a product of the electronic age, therefore I am organized and skilled at social networking such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Wordpress, and more. In fact, my personal twitter can be viewed here: twitter.com/brentthewalrus , but I digress. I am competent with deadlines and meeting requirements of specific tasks. I have a solid understanding of Israel, Judaism, Jewish roots, Christianity and the Church. I am very personable, highly skilled in linguistics, rhetoric, and communication, and am a great team player.

I would love to be able to speak with you further about this opportunity as well as setup an interview, either by phone or by skype. I believe this is a fantastic opportunity and something that I have been seeking, albeit in the back of my mind, to find and would love to be given the opportunity to work with a close-knit team. I will follow up within a week or two if no intercourse is made.

	*	Instructional material:  You need a critical thinker, eagerly facilitating both sides of the instructor-instructed partnership.  I've earned five years of experience educating children with autism, and I am a lifetime student with some course work for you to peruse.

	*	Inspiration and apologetics:  You may need a certified apologist, with an ever-expanding knowledge base in order to broaden the understanding of others.  Many of the items on my personal portfolio website are examples of this.

I am not afraid to think out-of-the-box, often coming up with solutions which are novel yet sound and logical. I believe that performance can be driven not only by the improving the behavior of the associate, but by adjusting to the behavior of the queue as well.

To Whom It May Concern:

My name is Jeremy Rice, and I am applying for the editorial assistant position with Bibles for Israel and The Messianic Prophesy Bible Project. While I do not come from a Jewish background, I was born and raised in a Christian home that placed a high value on the Word of God. My grandfather owned a Christian bookstore in Camp Springs, MD, where I worked for over five years. At the University of Maryland I served with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, an interdenominational organization that brought me into contact with believers from a variety of different backgrounds, including Messianic Jews. I have a keen interest in the Old Testament, Biblical history, and the role of the Jewish people in God's plan for salvation.

I believe I am highly qualified for an editorial position with your ministry. During my five years working in my grandfather's bookstore, I learned a great deal about various study Bibles and commentaries currently on the market. I also spend a great deal of time studying the Word for myself, both in personal devotion and as a Bible Study leader in the ministries in which I have served. This includes my ministry with InterVarsity, as well as a year working with troubled youth in residential treatment facility in Pierceton, Indiana.

In addition to my vested interest in the Jewish history and the study of the Word, I also work as a freelance writer and editor. I have a degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Maryland, where I also worked as copyeditor for The Diamondback, one of the most celebrated independent student newspapers in the nation. Copyediting, proofreading, researching and fact-checking are all second nature to me. I have great proficiency with Microsoft Office, blogging software, and social media marketing. In my work as a freelance editor, I have at times helped other authors set up blogs, Twitter and Facebook accounts, and accounts on other social media sites. While I freely admit that my experience with image editing software is low, I am a fast and self-motivated learner. I am more than willing to put in the time necessary to get up to speed in any task you may need me to do.

Attached is my resume, summarizing any work and volunteer experience not covered in this letter. Also included is a list of professional and personal references. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to working with you soon.

Sincerely,

My heart is blessed with a passion to reach Jewish people with the Truth that our Mashiach has come!  There is such a need for a tool that allows the Jewish people to read Torah and the Tanakh with explanation that will help the scales be removed, so that they may see that Yeshua is The Mashiach. The Messianic Prophecy Bible Project is an amazing way to bless the Jewish people and to help them discover that Yeshua is our King waiting for a personal relationship with each one of us.

My employment history, and more importantly the talents that Adonai has blessed to me, allow me to be rightly suited for this position. I have, collectively, five plus years working in the call center type position, including working from my home. I have done every aspect of call work including extensive customer service, sales, and market research interviewing. I also have several years experience in an administrative assistant type position answering multi-phone lines and scheduling appointments. I understand the phone employment position. What a blessing it would be to put this experience to work for The Kingdom!

Requirements:
· A passion for Yeshua
As I have stated, my passion is for Yeshua and for all His people to know His Truth, that He is our Mashiach.

· Must have a separate quiet private room at home to work from
My home office has more than adequate accommodations for this requirement.

· Have an up-to-date computer with a steady internet connection/minimum speed of 5MB
Satellite C655 Toshiba Laptop and AT&amp;T High speed DSL Internet

· Computer skills
Internet, social media, basic programs and software, Office, Word, and an ability to self learn 

· Detail oriented and organized
I have a meticulous attention to detail, as well as self motivation and self organization which are obviously key in completing work tasks in the home environment.

· Must have a desire to learn about Judaism and Israel
Adonai has blessed me with a great desire to learn about Judaism and Israel in current terms as well as our Hebraic roots. These Hebraic roots are the origin of what is common today in religion and secular society. I have spent years studying all aspects of Judaism from my own family's history and religion to the current events of the Political State of Israel. Another area of study for me has been the diasporas and assimilation of the Israelites from ancient times to present day and the great need to bless the people of HaShem with the Messianic Truth of Yeshua. 

· Must celebrate all of the Jewish Holidays
Our family is and has been blessed for several years to observe and celebrate all the Feasts and Observances ordained in Scripture. We also observe modern days of remembrance in a way honoring to HaShem. We do not observe the pagan holidays of society. We live by Torah, not the least of these, keeping the Shabbat Holy and all Kashrut.

· Must have a personal prayer life, and be able to pray with our donors over the phone
It is a blessing to see this on the list of requirements for this position. My Abba has poured out onto me a relationship that allows me to walk with His presence in such a way to be in constant communion with Him. In this I am always humbled when given an opportunity to pray with someone else for their needs or in thanksgiving for what Adonai has done. I also have several credentials in this particular area, including formal certification from the Central Florida Helpline. The Central Florida Helpline is an agency that has offered a prayer and counseling confidential phone line for the public. I also have certification from C.O.R.E. Competency, a certification from the State of Florida in Domestic Advocacy and Counseling.</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>Shalom.
Recently I learned of this available position of employment when inquiring for a friend. After reviewing the information I ask that you prayerfully consider me for this opportunity. I have been blessed to be out of the public work force for a few years home schooling my four children and reviving a small farm. However, over the last year my schedule has been transformed in such a way as to ready me for this time. I sincerely appreciate that no work is to be done on Yom Shishi or of course, on Shabbat.

 I am excited for the possibility of this position of employment. I have waited on my Lord in many things, not the least of these is His provision. He always provides and I know His will is in control. I thank you for your consideration for this and any other employment opportunities that may become available.

In the blessing of His Covenant,

For almost 2 years we lived in kibbuts Iron (on the boarder with Lebanon) and then we moved to Karmiel city.

Couple years ago the Lord led us to open humanitarian aid centers in different cities of Galilee and on its base start new congregations. Now we're working in Acco, Maalot, Hatsor, Nazareth and Tsfat.

 Talshahar, Erez</ns:TextResume><ns:SupportingMaterials><ns:AttachmentReference>To whom it may concern: 

I am a Toshav Chozer Katin candidate looking to relocate our family in Metro Be'er Sheva by the end of this month. A friend of ours, Kimberly Newton suggested that I contact you regarding potential employment. 

I have military service (American Army) and experience in office work (paralegal), insurance sales, construction, and food service. I've worked on a team and independently. I've held assistant management positions and training positions. I am fluent in English and have been called on periodically to speak to audiences of varying sizes (the largest being 500 members). I also am moderately fluent in Hebrew and am working on my reading and writing skills. I am a motivated learner and problem solver. 

Over the years I've had the privilege of working in multicultural settings from prepping food with Chinese chefs, who spoke almost no English, to working on a bilingual Hispanic / American construction crew, to my current employ with the Amish who speak Pennsylvania Dutch. In each case I absorb enough language to be conversant and accomplish our work objectives. 

I easily learn new competencies, particularly in mechanical fields. Because of my coursework at the University, I have a strong foundation in math and science, which makes me able to not only follow protocol for tasks, but in understanding the problem to find a variety of solutions.

Lastly, I was anointed as an Evangelist from our congregation in Orlando, Florida USA. I pursue Torah, worship on Shabbat, keep the feasts, don teffilin, pray the Amidah along with the other Hebrew prayers. 

I hope that we will be able to find a good fit for me within the Messianic Prophecy Bible Organization.

I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1986 and made Aliya with my parents in 1990.
I grew up in faith in "Peniel" congregation in Tiberias and served there as a youth worship leader.
I'm married to a Sabra born again wonderful wife named Ya'ara, which I met in Peniel's youth group.
Today I serve as a worship leader at "Tiferet Yeshua" congregation in Tel-Aviv and also preach there sometimes.
I'm looking to do something special for the Lord, something that will bear a lot of fruit for His kingdom.
As described in your website, it seems that this project is something big, and if it is - I want to be a part of it.

Looking forward to hear from you &amp; God bless,

My work in Turkey centered around learning the language and culture of the people along with making the Word of God relevant to the people that I was working with there.  My life in Israel has demanded a very similar focus in language and culture learning.  My position at Israel Today Magazine enabled me to have many one on one conversations with customers from the global Christian community.  Customer relations was my number one priority.  
     My position at the Bible Society in Israel has given me further opportunity to use my managerial skills as well as giving me the opportunity to understand the history behind the translations of the Bible and the source texts available.  The Bible Society has also given me unlimited opportunity to talk with Israelis about the Bible and Yeshua as the Messiah.  Through this I have been able to understand more clearly what Israelis are really searching for.
   I believe my background and experience make me the right person for a manager position at Bibles for Israel.

Thank you for your wonderful and much needed ministry.  Please accept my resume as application for part time work as a Messianic Communicator.  If possible, I would job share with Eva Gregg so that together we can fill one full time position.  I don't know if this is permissible but Eva and I are good friends and would work well together.

My spiritual journey has led me to be a Hebraic Christian who observes Sabbath, the dietary laws, and who keeps the Biblical feasts to the best of my ability.  I am part of a Hebraic Christian congregation that meets weekly for Bible study using the Torah portion readings.

My computer skills are excellent and I keep up with modern technology. I am easily available and usually respond to communications within twenty-four hours or less.  I do have Facebook and Twitter and am willing to join other social media to further the job.  I have a homeschool blog and in addition I am joining Chuck Swift Ministries to make Bible study materials without doctrine available to families for use with their children so that more people discover the complete truth of the Scriptures.  All of those internet materials are available without charge.

In addition to the above, Eva and I are starting a Hebraic Christian  homeschool ministry in our local area.  My part of that ministry is offered at no charge to the parents to teach parents how to homeschool.  We will observe a calendar centered around Sabbath and the Feasts.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to communicating with you at your convenience about this position.

Blessings in Yashua,
Patti Kowalchuk

I have believed in God my entire life.  I was a dedicated church attender, and youth leader for many years.  I studied the bible and took college classes concerning bible history.  The bible quickly became the most amazing book I had ever read and studied.  Then one day I was ask to teach the youth class every Sunday at the church I was attending.  I was scared to death.  I knew what I taught had better be the truth.  I sincerely with a humble and sincere heart went to my heavenly father and requested of him that HE would teach me His truth and that I would teach His truth to others.  I confessed to Him that I could not even stand before the class unless He held me up.  I confessed to Him that I did not know how to love Him with all my heart, soul and mind but I wanted to know how.  My life changed.  I started learning His truth.  People was sent into my life.  I was seeking Him and I found Him.  I soon repented of my pagan ways and started walking in His truths.  A man was sent to my office and challenged me about the Sabbath day.  I set out to help the man by teaching him Sunday was Sabbath.  To my dismay I found that I was wrong and I became a Messanic Jewish believer.  This was about 13 years ago.  I realized I had inherited lies and things that were unprofitable and it has been a delight to walk in His Sabbaths.  I believe I am grounded in His truths.  If there is anything I believe that is outside of His truth I desire it to be revealed to me and I desire to repent and return to His ways.  Yahshua has become our salvation and I love Israel and all the Jewish people.  I would really enjoy being a part of this work.  I started with my faith because this is most important in my life.  I have the qualities of a self starter and enjoy meeting people.  I have desired to work from home for sometime now.  This may be the reason.  We will see.  Please look at my resume and pray to see if I am the one for this position.  If He opens the door for me that is wonderful and if he does not that is wonderful too.  May His will be done.  

Blessings and Sweet Shalom,
Eva</Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pqPJ5gwO</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 4 - Online Training</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eH1POfw5</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Rafael</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Meir</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>12064322993</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>yeshuashalom@gmail.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Leh Leha program2008   Lev le Sharet Beble and Biblical Psychology program Certification2010  NA Certification2013 Languages ​​Russian English Hebrew Azerbaijan</ns:TextResume></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"><Field type="Candidate" name="Candidate Cover Letter">I believe this is God's will!

My Call to Salvation 
I come from a believing family of eleven siblings; where my mother raised us believing in Yeshua.  After witnessing my mother’s godly lifestyle, I was compelled to give my life to Yeshua at age seventeen.  After receiving the Lord I began delving into God’s word daily; and altering my lifestyle to suit the life Style Yeshua has called His believers to.


My Call to Ministry
 While entering college I developed a burden for learning Foreign Languages, which I later found out that it was to prepare me for the Foreign mission fields God called me to.  My first mission tour was to Spain; then Germany, and finally Italy (for eight years).  Among these tours I have taken short tours to Croatia; Holland; England; and Slovenia.  I now reside in Alaska where I continue to reach all those the Lord sends me to; with the Gospel of Yeshua/Jesus.

My Ministry Philosophy
 My ministry philosophy is that men/and women must hold steadfast to the inerrant word of God by not only knowing the word, but also doing it; if they desire to overcome the evil one.

I have been gifted in the area of communication and enjoy reaching out to many with encouragement from the word of G-d.

Dear Rachel Rozenstein:

For at least five years, I performed responsible work within an office environment.  I was a field representative with Countrywide Field Services, and an office assistant for Lake Arrowhead Chalets (a time share company).  This letter is in response to your current Messianic Communicator position.
In my previous employment, I daily responded to internal and external business inquiries.  All calls or inquiries to my desk had some level of urgency or importance so it was essential that I pay attention to details.  Whatever the circumstance, every call to my desk received my personal assistance, referral, or resolution.
I’m good at record keeping.  Since I would need to have office information readily available upon request, I daily maintained office databases containing various types of office or business related information.  Regularly, I performed routine office duties; such as, filing, typing, faxing, maintaining manuals, receiving and distributing mail, and ordering office supplies.  Additionally, I have good writing skills, so I assisted with correspondence letters or memos.  Keeping a calendar to schedule appointments or meetings was also part of my job.  I’m skilled with Microsoft Word, Excel, and Outlook.  I represented the office with professionalism and upheld confidentiality to sensitive issues.  I’m also highly experienced in customer service.  With regard to my education, I have 49 semester college units.
I’m confident that I can perform the essential tasks of a Messianic Communicator. I’m asking that you kindly consider me for the position.  To ensure your confidence of my qualifications and ability to do the job, I encourage you to speak to Denise Vasquez, office manager for Lake Arrowhead Chalets.  She can be reached at 909-337-0457.  Thank you for your time and consideration.


Cordially,


Monica R Lopez

My name is Pastor Jennifer Ellis. I am the Associate Pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship Church in Bristol, TN.  I am writing to you because I am interested in your position as a Messianic Communicator. 

In spite of the fact that I attend a non-denominational church, I am deeply rooted in the Messianic community here and have taken a Ruth vow to the Lord to identify with and love the Jewish people. This journey started some 19 years ago for me when I began seeking to know more about the Messiah through learning theJewish roots of the Christian faith. I enjoy keeping the feasts and teaching others about them.  I love the Lord, and I desire for others to come to know Him and return to the original model of worship and practice that the apostles demonstrated in the Word. I have been to Israel once, in 2004. I fell in love with the land and its people. I really did not want to come back to the states.

Additionally, I have a BS in communications with an emphasis in technical writing. I have served for two years as the Executive Secretary of Unity in the Community, a budding local organization. Currently, I serve as the Treasurer for the same organization. 

I would really like the opportunity to learn more about your organization and the position you are looking to fill. I believe we would be a good fit for each other. 

Sincerely,



Pastor Jennifer Ellis

I have been a Believer since 1982 and over the years have been an itinerant women’s conference speaker, and Bible Study teacher. In 2005 our family joined Baruch HaShem Messianic Congregation in Dallas, Texas, and rapidly became involved in not only the keilah but in the vision of being a light to the Jewish people among us.  I have been able, through the teaching of Rabbi Marty Waldman and various Yeshivas, to deepen my understanding of G-d’s covenant relationship with His people Israel.  

I have served the Baruch HaShem Congregation in various capacities over the past 8 years.  My service has included: Director of the Homeschool Co-op, Director of the Children’s Interactive Passover Seder, and member of the Medical Visitation Team.  My current service to the congregation is as follows:  Hebrew Department Director, Worship Department Ministry Assistant, Hot Line Prayer Intercessor Leader, Sisterhood Council Member.  All of my ministry areas involve working with others and communicating ideas and visions.  This aspect of my service would prove to be an asset to the stated position of Messianic Telephone Communicator.

Additionally, I have a working knowledge of various Bible software and programs such as, Logos, Net Bible, Accordance, Biblos, Blueletter Bible, etc.  This working knowledge will enable me to provide a clear vision and explanation of the Messianic Prophecy Bible Project.

I would welcome the opportunity to be a part of this exciting project and an integral member of your team.

Shalom,

Terri Harper

The Gospel is something that I’m passionate about.

As a Messianic Jew with a Sephardic Jewish background, it was always difficult for me to define my cultural ethnicity. As a Jew, you may already know of the constant discrimination faced on a daily basis, especially when it comes to speaking about the truth of Messiah Yeshua to both Jews and Gentiles. I, for one, can tell you that through all the adversity and the many different challenges, I’m seriously involved with preaching Messiah Yeshua to the nations of the earth, where I reach approximately 500,000 people all around the world at no cost to any specific organization; I do so because I believe wholeheartedly in what the Scriptures say about Yeshua.

For quite some time, I’ve been praying and contemplating on developing Messianic Jewish programs that could help the body of Messiah at an international level. I just didn’t know how or when. Still, I committed myself in the arduous task to obey Hashem’s voice, stepping foot into Christian Churches to teach about Messiah’s cultural origins while maintaining true to my cultural origins as a Sephardic Jew. As opposed to being a good Jewish kid and finishing my pre-Med program, I just responded to Messiah’s call in making disciples of the nations.

As a Messianic Communicator, I believe that I can achieve greater goals. So, when I got your email, I had to first thank Hashem. My collegiate education along with my fluency in Spanish and Portuguese makes me an excellent candidate as a spokesperson for this program. Also, my ten years of first-hand knowledge within Orthodox Judaism, and now Messianic Judaism, gave me a deeper respect for Torah and to teach believers of the importance of the Biblical language, besides the fact that I got to learn more about my Sephardic Jewish culture. Similarly, my ability to interact across a multicultural diverse community from all spiritual backgrounds and walks of life placed me in the position to interact with people (even Chinese Believers) who are truly passionate of learning of the Jewish Roots of the Bible. Lastly, Hashem has blessed me to the point of interacting with both the impoverished as well as the affluent in society, with people who haven’t noticed biblical importance of the Hebrew language as well as with people who takes Scriptures to heart.

Rachel, I would like to thank you for reaching out to me and hope that you consider me for this position

Director Human Resources
Bibles for Israel


Shalom Rachel;

Firstly, Chag Sameach Pesach! I am writing in response to an email invitation to apply for an open job position for a “Messianic Communicator” for Bibles for Israel. My name is Joel Allen and I have been a Messianic Torah Observant believer in Yeshua for over 7 years now. Prior to being Torah observant, my wife and I served in an inner city Christian church located in Syracuse, NY as children’s Pastors.  I am currently a Pastor/Rabbi of a local Messianic Fellowship located in Upstate New York called Messianic Family Fellowship (www.messianicfamilyfellowship.com) which began as a small Bible study in our home. My wife and I also write messianic teachings and homeschool curriculums for Christian and Messianic groups all over the world as an online ministry located at www.restoringtheway.org and www.restoringtheway.com . 
I am confident that my experience in both Christian and Messianic faiths will greatly enhance the wonderful ministry that you have in Bibles for Israel. This is a ministry that I am passionate about and have dedicated my life to. This job opportunity is something that I have been praying diligently for and it will help our family fill in a financial gap as we are in full time ministry. 
I also have extensive knowledge in internet marketing, search engine optimization, social networking and web design. With over 10 years of experience in marketing and what I currently use as my supplemental income I am excited to bring my passion and experience to Bibles for Israel. I would be willing to work full or part time as I am very flexible and have a private office in my home dedicated for ministry and business. I look forward to hearing from you soon and I pray YHVH’s many blessings upon you and your ministry.
Shalom Aleichem,

Joel R Allen

Ms. Rachel Rozenstein
Director of Human Resources
The Messianic Jewish Bible Society
Bibles For Israel - Tiberias, Israel

Dear Ms. Rozenstein:

As a Gentile follower of Yeshua, I have a desire to see the gospel presented to the Jewish people in its original, Tanakh-based context. Several years ago, I was pleased to hear that development had begun on The Messianic Prophecy Bible Project. I look forward to the day when what I believe will be a highly valuable resource will be made available. Therefore, I was excited to read your email about the possibility of becoming a Messianic Communicator. As someone who has worked in customer service for several years now, I am more than capable when it comes to meeting the expectations of clients and enthusiastically reaching out to constituents.

As I mentioned, and as you will see from the submitted résumé, I have almost ten years’ of customer service experience, working for global organizations like AT&amp;T and Apple. During these years, I developed the ability to empathetically listen to customers and not only seek to resolve their immediate issues, but also any underlying matters. In other words, my goal was to provide complete customer satisfaction. Perhaps more importantly, however, is my passion for the Bible and the spread of the gospel among all people, especially the Jewish people. For more than five years I have led a small group Bible study, guiding people into understanding the Christian faith in its original, Jewish context. Additionally, it is has been my goal to lead Christians into a greater understanding of Judaism, especially for purposes of communication between the Jewish people and Christians, emphasizing Jewish sensitivities.

Thank you for taking the time to read this cover letter and review my résumé. I look forward to speaking with you soon about how I can contribute to The Messianic Prophecy Bible Project. You may reach me through email at dancalcagno@hotmail.com or by calling me at 289-271-0340.

Yours sincerely,

Daniel Calcagno</Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pLQh6gwJ</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 4 - Online Training</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eRnfPfw2</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Maureen</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Leary</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>843-488-9929</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:InternetEmailAddress>doglover1@sccoast.net</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>I have over 10 years ex working as a telemarketer and 2 years working with members as a referral representative .

Rachel Rozenstein, director of Human Resources for Bibles for Israel,

My ultimate desire and purpose for my daily life is to glorify God and to serve people to the best of my ability. As a messianic Jew, I set out to present the gospel to my Jewish people by directly engaging the community. I have worked as a telemarketer, bookkeeper, ministry representative, director, and teacher where I had to lead but also follow. I know God has prepared and chosen me to not only be a light but also a voice for the Messiah to the  Nations and to our Jewish people. For this reason, working as a messianic communicator would not only allow me to further the calling that God has on my life, but also to assist in bringing the kingdom of God to earth by presenting the gospel and the Jewish Scriptures in a Messianic light. I have a deep love for my Jewish people, the Scriptures, Israel, Judaism and I have a strong desire to learn. I am always ready and willing to take the initiative for any task given to me. I know with my hard working, dedicated, trustworthy, passionate, relational, innovative, and audacious work ethic and character; I will be more than a compatible fit for the Messianic Jewish Bible Society. 

I believe my resume will speak further on my behalf. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

All through the owing of my businesses, and now being in ministry full time for the last five years, has given me an acute awareness of the needs and temperament of those I call on.

Being a Messianic Believer since the late 1980's, and with my in-depth study of Judaism and the culture – being able to visit Israel as well, I find to be versed with anyone I speak with, with compassion regarding the Jewish people and history.   

For the past twenty four years I have been celebrating the Feasts, and just last week we were apart of three Seders. One on Tuesday was a small church in our area who loves Israel. Only the Pastor there had any knowledge of the Seder. We used a Messianic Haggadah, and afterwards opened up for discussion. Ever since then we have heard reports of the congregants having dreams and visions. Yesterday we heard that someone who had a vision of the Lord sifting them as a congregation. So it is exciting to be able to minister in the Name of Yeshua!

Thank you,

Dear Rachel and MJBS Team,
 
Just the other morning I was praying for a vocation that would enable me to share the truth of Yeshua and Torah with people around the world. This type of opportunity seemed like an impossible request, but as the scriptures say, with YHVH, all things are possible. Later in the day I received a call that informed me of a communicator position with Messianic Jewish Bible Society, so words cannot express how thrilled (and shocked) I am to be applying for the job of my dreams! 
 
21 years ago I became a believer. For the last 13 years I have been studying the Hebraic roots of the scriptures. This transition came though my love for the Father, intense Biblical study, and the ability to be separated unto G-d while worshipping among those who reject the Jewishness of Jesus. Thankfully, YHVH has since blessed this community with a Torah-observant, Messianic Fellowship where I can freely worship in Spirit and in Truth. The Rabbi of this congregation once sat at my dining room table as a Christian pastor, where I shared with him the Torah in the New Testament. After several years of study and a growing need for a local fellowship, he now has a thriving Hebraic-roots ministry that reaches the local and world-wide community!  
 
As a representative of Messiah, I would like to be considered for the Messianic Telephone Communicator position with Messianic Jewish Bible Society. Having held positions of being in and under authority, I am fully capable to serve as a manager or representative. I am an enthusiastic, steady and dependable worker, who practices accountability, respect, teamwork &amp; excellence. 
 
Please allow me the opportunity to speak with you regarding the communicator position. My phone number is 315-569-5011. I look forward to hearing from you!
 
Sincerely, 
Rhonda Perkins

I am an organized self-starter and I believe that I can be of benefit to your organization.  My family and I will continue to pray about this to be sure that this position is a good fit for me.

Shalom,

Employment
Currently employed at The Plant Place and Cameron Greenhouse,  Cameron Mo.
I started out 10+ years ago as a delivery person part time and worked my way up to designer by attending workshops and design classes. The owner trained me in technique and my natural talent for design gave me the rest. My duties include taking phone orders, assisting walk in customers as well as creating floral designs for the display coolers.
My previous work history was Night Manager at Country Mart    Cameron Mo. I was employed for 6 years with that company. My Job duties went from Deli worker to produce manager to night manager in my 6 year career there. I was terminated for my spiritual beliefs.
Prior to that I was a stay at home Mom.
Education
1970-1973 Polytechnic High School   Sun Valley Ca.
I did not graduate. I have no formal degrees.
I have taught myself computer skills through trial and error and from asking a lot of questions to people with the formal training such as my brother. I have experience in web design as well as data entry. I know my way around a computer and can run and operate most software. I know enough about software to figure out what I need to know to run it.
I have a successful online clothing shop on Etsy.com where I sell my up-cycled clothing line www.etsy.com/shop/upcycledrose
I am also on facbook with a business page www.facebook.com/gypsychibymona as well as a personal page.
Personal
I have been a Christian most of my life, and I’ve always had questions no one could answer until I started seeking out my Jewish Roots in Yeshua. I have been on this journey for over 10 years. I have been called prayer warrior, wailing woman and prophet. I only know that I love Yahweh with all that is inside me. When He says “Pray” I pray! When He says “Speak” I speak. I do know that I have been called as a Watchman upon the wall and I have chosen to answer that call.
This job with your organization will allow me to quit my job where I am required to work on Saturdays and during and on Holy Feast Days of Yahweh. It will allow me more time for prayer and study of His word and His way. It would be an honor to be part of your team.
Thank you for your time.

I am a Feast keeper, my only drawback would be my job I have outside my home which requires me to work every other Sabbath, and some Feast Days I have to work.

Dear Ms. Rozenstein,

We spoke on the telephone in March, 2013 about the Messianic Communicator position, and your organization’s mission.  I was made aware of this position through Tikvat Israel in Cleveland, Ohio, since I am a Jewish believer following Messiah Yeshua, attending this Messianic Jewish congregation – made of Jewish and Christian believers. 

This is a great time in my life because my professional and spiritual purposes are culminating into a common theme of bringing-people-together.  This will bring an immediate impact to reach your donors and Christian constituency.

 	First, having grown up in predominately Christian/Gentile neighborhoods, while attending orthodox Jewish synagogues,  I learned many varied cultural and religious differences separating Judaism and Christianity.  Later I saw differences separating Christians and Messianic Jews in understanding Scripture’s Jewish writers.  Through my own persecutions, I identified with those imposed on our Messiah Yeshua..  Having lived on “both sides of the proverbial fence”,  I formed a Jewish Messinic ministry to help bring common understanding between Christian and Jewish believers under one Messiah Yeshua and one God of Israel. 
 	Next, I understand your organization’s role and this Messianic Communicator position through my Messianic Jewish ministry, where I establish relationships with Christian pastors – planting the seed of togetherness - for the purposes of advancing understandings between Christian &amp; Messianic Jewish believers.  I teach believers Scripture from a Jewish perspective with Hebrew and Greek epistle interpretations.  Also I developed a vision with plans to organize a fund-raising Walking Event in Cleveland, Ohio to support Israel.
 	Thirdly, as a professional leader in the advancement of technology development, I am accustomed in organizing collaborative relationships to match best technology with project goals.  Throughout my professional career, major organizations, such as, Comcast Cellular, AT &amp; T, have benefited from my leadership, creativity, and strategic approaches. Some accomplishments include, idea-selling, advocacy, team project management improvements with large cost savings and new best-practice methods.
 	Lastly, I am in the process of developing a review of national Bibleworks software.

From position-to-position throughout my career, and now in ministry, my purposes in life are culminating into finding new methods to improve and establish collaborations with advancement of deeper understandings.  I therefore have a clear understanding of your position’s requirements, and I believe that I am highly qualified for this position and will make an immediate impact.  

Also through my ministry and contacts, I will have the opportunity to share your mission.

Thank you for your time in considering me for this position of Messianic Communicator position.  

References can be supplied upon request.

Please find enclosed my resume for your review.

I will contact you on April 10, 2013 to confirm receipt of my information, and to schedule a following interview.

 CHRISTIAN SERVICE RECORD

Born again: April 1974 in Service Pastor Ed Roebert, then Hatfield Baptist Church

Filled with Holy Spirit April 1974 Apostolic Faith Mission (A. F. M.): Voortrekkerhoogte.

Baptised in water November 1974:  A F M. Hercules.

From the onset as Christian I was a soul winner.  It was during the Rhodesian and Angolan wars.  I worked in the No1 Military Hospital, Voortrekkerhoogte.  Led many souls to the Lord and was actively involved in the rehabilitation of drug addicts.

Loved the Word of God from the day I was born again.

During 1980 an A. F M Church was planted in Nigel in the area for the Coloured people.  We were two ladies when we begun the ministry and when I left Nigel, there were 84 members in the newly built Church.

From 1997 to 2003 we were again two ladies who began a Cell group within the Dept of Land Affairs.  By the end of 2003 there were between 40 and 76 people in the service on a Wednesday.  Pastor Hardus Pretorius has ministered to them on a few occasions (during Easter and at the year end) as well.  This ministry is still an ongoing ministry.

During this time the Lord taught me lay hands on people to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit.  This is still the main area of ministry when invited to teach at the different churches.  Pastor Hennie Maree has been sending me to the different churches to minister the baptism in the Holy Spirit.  He can confirm the baptisms as well as Pastor Phineas Khumalo in Soshanguve, Molotto, Hamanskraal and Mamelodi.

Have been praying for the sick, with many confirmed healings.  The Lord has called me to teach and equip believers to pray for the sick, as many that have the calling on their lives, but are unsure as what to do in practice.   Have been doing this course from home and later from classrooms in school on Church grounds as my house became too small.

At the end of the year 1999 the Lord also spoke to me about Brothers and Sisters in Christ who are in prison.  That I am to teach them and to minister the Holy Spirit unto them. This ministry, to date, has spread as wild fire in the prisons in the Northern Province with many souls saved, and baptised in the Holy Spirit.  During the month of March 2008 the SABC will tape a program in the prison.

I have been teaching the healing course at the prisons as well, with many people healed and delivered.  So much so that people come from outside the prison to the prison to be prayed for!

Have been teaching at Charis Bible College since its inception Jan 2000, until Dec 2005.  (Although I was then a first year student).

Have planted a Bible College at Hammanskraal at the beginning of 2004 under the auspices of Charis Church and Past Hardus Pretorius. Did all the administration and most of the teaching.  All students have passed their first year and therefore the College has moved into its second year in 2005.  A new Spearpoint Bible College was planted in Kutama Sinthumule Maximum Prison 2006 and is still functioning with 400 students.  A satellite branch was also established in Sunnyside.

Have been to Botswana and Namibia on outreaches with Pastor Hardus Pretorius. Past Pretorius now pastoring Harvest Community Church in Montana and Hammanskraal.

Healing School at Dept of Land Affairs, Mamelodi and at home with up to 22 students per session.  Established Healing School at Kutama Sinthimule Maximum Prison and Pretoria Max Prison.

Have been part of the Third Day Apostolic Network since 2002 to date.

Doing tent crusades and outreaches with Pastor Thebogo Molapo, under the watchful eye of Pastor Ron Kinnear, Africa Missions.

During April 2007 did International Missions tour to Taiwan for OM.  Teaching on and ministering the Healing power of God.

During July 2007 did International Missions tour to Uganda, Mountain Kingdom of Torro, Burundi and Rwanda with Africa Missions.  Teaching on, and ministering the Healing power of God.

Teaching and ministering the Healing Power of God in all A F M Churches in preparation for the centenary celebration of the A F M in May 2008.  Traveling and ministering extensively all over South Africa.

Planting and establishing Healing Rooms on the John G Lake principles within all the A F M Churches on the African continent.  Currently there are already 8 fully functioning Healing Rooms.

Planted satellite AFM branch in Sonop, Brits with a couple. Now, after 2 years, pastoring 50 members.

CURRENT PROJECTS

And I want to be part of the great movement of yours.</Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pqFj7gwg</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 4 - Online Training</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eSd2PfwG</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Benjamin</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Shadwick</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>870-243-1151</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>870-243-1151</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>path2rest@gmail.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume><![CDATA[Benjamin Shadwick

•	Surgical staff nurse for Arkansas Methodist Medical Center, Paragould Arkansas (2007- current)  Three months for 40 hours week for total of 120 hours.  Learn to reacquaint myself with surgical techniques and acclimating to working in surgery again.  Learning new people and adjusting to new routines.  Glad for this new test.


2. Conferences I have attended…title… hours involved…lessons learned.

	Hyles-Anderson Pastors Conference, Hammond, Indiana ( 1976 for a full week of 12 hour days for a total of 60 hours.  I learned that the Holy Spirit is a gift to us and all we much do is ask the Father for this gift.  I have seen sence that time that the Holy Spirit has been very active in my life.  Funny thing was I prayed in tongues in that meeting which was Baptist and no one even believes in that.  I would not get this experience for many years later.
	Rose Ann Coleman Conference, “Living As A Pipe For the Holy Spirit” Montgomery Bell State park, Tennessee (1990) Week end conference that was about 12 hours of sessions.  I learned even more that the Father loves me and that He wants to work through me.  I could be a pipe which He would flow through.  I have taken these lesions through the rest of my life.  I have scene that when I am empty, He can flow.
	Twelve week study of the book of Ephesians, Woodmont Baptist Church, Nashville, Tennessee (1991) 18 hours of concentrated study on the book of Ephesians.  Not only learning more about the free grace of God but I learned how to hear from others and discover what God had told them and how many times it was not what I already knew or even had ever thought about.  There were young people in their twenties as when as Senior adults in their 70’s and 80’s.  Yet, the class was still small at about a dozen.
	Youth Specialties Conference, Woodmont Christian Church, Nashville, Tennessee (1992) This was a one day 8 hour conference which deal with youth materials and how to go through materials for teaching quickly and efficiently.  I was able to see discover how to look at books and classes for their efficient use for teaching. 
	Experiencing God 13 week lesson, Henry Blackaby’s course about how to really experience God. Woodmont Baptist Church (1993) I learned how to see where God is moving and be attuned to look to see where He is working and how to get involved with the move of His holy Spirit.  Years later I would discover this in a church in Florida, Brownsville, The Spirit was there in great power and manifestations and wonders.
	Promise Keepers Conference, “Break Down The Walls” Memphis, Tennessee (1996) 10 hours. I learned about Spiritual Warfare for the first time at this conference.  I don’t think I ever though of spiritual warfare until this conference. I also had incredible worship experiences at this conference.  Singing “How Great Thou Art’ with over 40,000 other men is an experience I will never get over.  It was a taste of heaven when all the redeemed will be able to sing praises to the King.
	Promise Keepers Conference, “Making Of a Godly Man” Knoxville, Tennessee (1997) 10 hours, I learned how I need to really commit to Jesus Christ, really commit. I need to be committed to Him, my wife, my family, my church and my job.  I learned the value of becoming a servant.  This really begun to be incorporated into my life.  I became less concerned with things I wanted to do and more concerned with the interests of others.
	Baptist Youth World Conference, Huston, Texas (1998) five day conference on worship in other nations, Total at least 40 hours.  I learned the difficulty of living as a Christian in other nations of the world.  For instance in Korea the church had to be underground. Yet the pastor had brought his dance team to this world conference which had about 25,000 youth and their leaders from all over the globe.  They gave beautiful worship dances praising the Lord Jesus Christ.  I saw worship from African nations.  One pastor in Kenya was just praying for a thousand dollars so he could get a metal roof for his church building.  My thought was how a door in our church would cost more than that.  It was a very humbling experience.
	Promise Keepers Pastor and Leadership Conference, Atlanta, Georgia (1998) 10 hours.  Learned how pastors and leader for Jesus need to honor one another.  The church of Jesus Christ is not about denominations and division but rather in breaking down the walls.
	Promise Keepers, “Go The Distance” Atlanta, Georgia (2000) 10 hours about fighting the good fight for Jesus.  Everything that I do in life needs to be done for Jesus.
	Passion One day Conference, “Boasting Only In The Cross”  John Piper was the main leader-speaker for this conference in Memphis, Tennessee (2000) All we do is nothing to brag about.  All our ability and our skill, and our talents can only be attributed to the Lord Jesus Christ.  Only in Him and the work He did on Calvary can we boast in that and in that alone.
	Promise Keepers Conference, “Turn The Tide” (2001) Nashville, Tennessee 10 hours about how we need to pray for America and for revival in this nation.  The tide can be turned as we are in the Kingdom of God and His Kingdom is here now.  I need to be about advancing the Kingdom of God in my life.  I need to be a revolutionary for the Kingdom of God. 
	Promise Keepers Conference, “Storm The Gates” (2002) Knoxville, Tennessee 10 hours about intense spiritual warfare. Realizing the enemy wants to devour us, our family, and our church.  Spoke much about intercessory prayer. Pray for yourself, your family, your church, your pastor.  Be obedient. 
	Howard Morgan Ministries, “Panim El Panim” (2006)  24 hours of intense worship, praise and hearing from GOD. A conference about coming face to face with God.  Very Holy Spirit anointed conference.  Learned more about seeking and coming into the presence of GOD.

3. Conferences I have led or been a part of leading…Title…hours involved…lessons 
                       learned.
	River of Life Conference, Ocoee, Tennessee (1992) this was five 1 hour sessions and prep time of over 10 hours for a total of 15 hours.  It was about the River of the Past, God has always been, The River Of the Future, God will always be and He holds our future so there is not need for fear, He is in the River of now, there is a River of God that flows now in the believer and how to go to that River, in faith.  I learned so much about God’s love and concern for me.  That He is always near and cares about ever little aspect of my life.  It was my first conference to lead and it was great.
	Experiencing God, Henry Blackaby, I had taken this course and now I taught the thirteen week class to Senior High Youth, over 50 hours of work counting study, prep time, and teaching the lesson.  Also, much counseling of youth and their parents resulted because of these sessions.  It was a very powerful time of seeing God work.  I learned that God will show up in people’s lives in big ways.  He wants holiness from His people.  
	Fusion Retreat, Crossville, Tennessee,(1993) 50 hours approximate. A weekend retreat with morning, afternoon, and evening sessions.  Also, recreation activities including games, sports, drama, interpretive dance, music, singing, puppets, and other  creative arts.  I worked with about seven other youth ministers from, Crossville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville who all planned this weekend together.  Hours of meetings and individual time was spent planning this very Spirit filled youth retreat.  I learned so many lessons about ministering to youth at these activities.  Love for youth and a desire to see them come to the LORD and grow and mature in Him was the ongoing thing I learned that had the most value for me.
	Spark weekend, Nashville, Tennessee, (1993) 30 hours approximate, A retreat of youth group breaking into small groups of about six and spending a weekend in the spring of various church families.  Usually young married with no children.  The topic would be one that was to stimulate spiritual growth and increase their relationship with one another and the LORD.  I had to plan the activities, the basic structure for the lessons, and make the arrangements in general.  I learned just how hungry teenagers really are to have a strong relationship with Jesus.  My closeness to Jesus would always improve during these times.  It was always a time for introspection.  Great sharing would take place at the end.
	Centrifuge Youth Retreat, Mobile, Alabama (1993) A full seven day retreat for youth. Easily at least 100 hours of study and preparation time. These retreats would take place on college campuses.  They would be filled with sermons, praise and worship services each morning and evening.  The youth group would be divided up in age groups and mixed with youth from other churches.  Each Bible study group was about 15 number and the entire group was over 300.  There was also activities of creative arts, music, puppets, interpretive dance, preaching, evangelism, and even classes on such things as cults, and sharing your faith with difficult people.  I was responsible for making all the arrangements for this camp.  I was responsible for our entire youth group while at this camp for the week. I learned responsibility in a big way.  I learned more how to manage people and how they will  try to take advantage of situations.  I leaned not to be watchful.  Also, I learned with the help of only the Holy Spirit how to better council youth as many issues would surface during this week of intense closeness with the LORD.
	Spark Weekend, Nashville, Tennessee (1994) 30 hours approximate, Similar to Spark Weekend in 1993.
	Fusion weekend, Crossville, Tennessee(1994) 50 hours approximate, Similar to Fusion Weekend in 1993
	Centrifuge Youth Retreat, Panama City Beach, Florida (1994) 100 hours approximate, Similar to Centrifuge 1993
	Spark Weekend, Nashville, Tennessee (1995) 30 hours approximate, done in same format as other Spark weekends.
	Fusion Weekend, Crossville, Tennessee (1995) 50 hours approximate, same format as other Fusions.
	Centrifuge Youth Retreat, Carson Newman University, Tennessee (1995) Same format as other Centrifuges.  This time however I learned how God’s voice can be very specific.  He told me to ask a certain girl in the youth group if she would like to be Baptized as she was saved but had not as yet followed the command of baptism. She was very excited to be baptized with the entire youth group witnessing.  It was a very anointed time of worship.  It was done under a water fall called “Laurel Falls” in the Smoky Mountains.  It was a witness to many nonbelievers who were there as well.
	Spark weekend, Nashville, Tennessee (1996) 30 hours approximate, As other Spark Weekends.
	Fusion weekend, Crossville, Tennessee (1996) 30 hours approximate, As other Fusion Weekends
	Centrifuge Youth Retreat, Carson Newman University (1996), 100 hours approximate, Like other Centrifuges.

	Spark weekend, Nashville, Tennessee (1998) 30 hours approximate
	Baptist Youth World Fellowship, Huston, Texas (1998) five day intensive conference with much logistical planning involved.  Meeting with members of a black church that we went together with to the conference.  This was a very powerful way to bring interracial youth together. At the conference there was youth from around the globe.  It was very eye opening to see Christians from places like Africa, Europe, and underground churches from Korea and China.  Much was learned and experienced form this conference that involved over 100 hours of planning and participation.

6.	Other Ministry Activities I have been involved in.
	Mission Trip to Tullahoma, Tennessee (1994)  This was a week long trip to take small group very willing to do hard work.  We were installing insulation in the ceiling of a new rural Baptist Church.  It was a one week mission in the heat of the summer.  I learned the joy of working very hard and not getting any pay except for the satisfaction of helping others. Found how I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
	Living Word Ministries mission trip to Israel, Our small congregation went to Israel to show support for the Israel Defense Force.  This was when bus bombings were happening at a regular pace.  The people of Israel had very low moral.  We visited the troops in places the regular visitors are not allowed to go.  Our pastor had a special relationship with Gilla Treibiech our guide.  She had connections with the IDF.   We also helped out an orphanage near Jerusalem.  We showed the love of Jesus as much as possible.  It was a real life changing experience for me.  It planted the seed that made me realize as believers we are connected to Israel.  In gave me a whole new understanding of Romans chapter 11.  As Paul has said we as Gentile believes need to bring the Jew to a godly jealously. 
	Feast Of Tabernacles (Sukot)  Celebration (2005), Fort Walton Beach, Florida.  Our Church, Living Word Ministries lead this celebration.  It is a time of great joy because the fulfillment of this feast will be when Jesus Christ tabernacles with us on earth for a thousand years.  I was on the dance team “Rahad” which means to dance in Hebrew.  We practiced every Sunday for two hours for about four months before this event.  I learned how to dance with joy before the LORD.  I learned to become undignified and not to be concerned how I looked or what people thought when I worshipped before my Abba.  It is something that has changed my life forever.
	  Feast Of Tabernacles Celebration, “Beyond the Veil” (2006) Fort Walton Beach, Florida.  This was similar to what we did in 2005 but much more extravagant. We danced to the live music of Paul Wilber,  a very well known worship leader.  My dance skills improved and it seemed that dancing before the LORD had become effortless.  This year the service was more anointed and worshipful.  It makes me think in just a glimpse of what it will be like to worship our King Forever.  This year focused on His return.  It makes me want to always be ready to meet Him.  
	Living Word Mission Trip to Israel, (2006) Again to support the IDF as the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.  They do not understand why we love and support them as Christians but they show humble appreciation for our visit.  We have a  Christian solidarity march for Israel in the streets of Jerusalem, sponsored by the International Christian Embassy of Jerusalem.  The people of Jerusalem food the streets as we tell them we love them and give the children small American Flags and candy.  Over 60 other nations are represented in this parade as well.  It makes you think about the one day fulfillment of Zechariah 14 when he says all nations will come year after year for the feast of Tabernacles.  Hallelujah!  I experienced such joy that I can not really explain it.  I have just grown so much closer to Him by going to His Holy Land.

7.	Other activities I have been involved in… description of them, length of time and  
       lessons learned.
	Antioch High School band President for my daughter’s band.  (1995)  Helped manage the bands activities with the Band Director.  The competitions they would perform in.  The trips they would take. The fund raisers they would do.  It was a very busy job with and average of 15 hours a week during the marching band season which when from August to January.  It was a wonderful experience as I leaned to work with other parents and other teenagers.  It was a job of much stress and little thanks but the reward was when you know you made a difference in a teens live and you did.
	Finished the Florida Ironman three times (1999, 2000, 2004)  It is a triathlon consisting of a 2.4 mile ocean swim in very dangerous waters, a 112 mile bike ride on some dangerous sections of highway, and a full 26.2 mile marathon.  I did this three times and the training was so wonderful because I could go out and ride my bike for hours and just pray and hear from GOD.  I learned that I can do more than I ever thought I could.  That with the LORD’s help nothing is impossible.  This is a secular event and one not really for the purpose of honoring God but to me I will always hold it dear. When asked why do something so extreme? My only answer is because He allowed me to.  Bless His Holy name.

The most important reason but hard to measure is the fact this position seems cookie cutter made just for me and especially for this time.  I have had an intense desire to see Jews come to Messiah for many years now.  I understand that telling them they need to accept Jesus is not such a good plan as they have been through the Russian Pogroms, the Spanish Inquisition, Crusades, the Holocaust, all in the name of Jesus.  But this Bible is perfect for them.
     
I came to know Yeshua in the Baptist Church and I am very grateful for this but I see a much greater depth and understanding over the past twenty years of growing in my own Jewish roots.  I understand how most Christians think and therefore know how to speak to them about Israel.  I have many Jewish friends both in Israel and the United States.  I Am able to give them little seeds of the love of Yeshua and not turn them away.  

I understand that the Jews will be won to Yeshua partly by Gentiles who love them and have themselves been grafted into the tree that is Israel.  Paul spoke in Romans 11 quoting from Deuteronomy that the Jews would be made jealous by a foolish nation.  I understand that true believers are that foolish nation.  I am ready to made a fool or whatever else it may take to stand next to my Jewish brothers and sisters.  I believe our Father in heaven has anointed me for this very important mission. Which is getting the truth in  the hands of HIS people.  I have been to Israel eight times (new beginnings) and each time I discern more openness to hear about Yeshua.  I was able to give twenty Hebrew New Testaments from the Bible Society in Israel during Pesach of 2012. But please know they were prayed over and where only given to Jews who accepted them.  I was so amazed at how they accepted them.  I believe the time is very short and we must do all we can with fervent urgency. For my hearts desire is for “all of Israel to be saved.”  But I understand it has to be done in the leading of the Holy Spirit.  

Finally, I was an ordained pastor in the Southern Baptist denomination and then in the very early 1990’s the Holy Spirit impressed on my heart that Yeshua was crucified on the Passover.  This started a move on my heart which has been a most incredible and wonderful journey.  In the late 90’s I was attending a Messianic Congregation and in 2007 the LORD moved my wife, Sheral and me to Arkansas to begin a Messianic congregation here.  The LORD has taught me to be all things to all men in order to increase His wonderful Kingdom.  So this is in a very short way why I know I am called for this most important position. Thank you for your time and consideration and please visit our congregations website at www.path2restoration.org.

I have been praying and waiting for the Father to release me from my current position and find a way to work for His glory.  While I like many things about my job,including being  free to be able to pray for others, there are things that no longer feel right in my spirit. 

It was not very long after getting my current job that our eyes were opened to the truth of Torah, and keeping the commandments of Adonai.  As a family, we keep all the biblical feast days.  We are now in our fourth Torah cycle.  Since the Father has brought us out of traditional Christianity I have longed to come home, even though I enjoy many things about working.   A position like this would be ideal, and would seem to be an answer to prayer.  

I do have a quiet place to work, good computer and internet speed of at least 6mbps.  I am computer and internet savvy, and able to pick up new things fairly easily.  I am on multiple social networks including facebook, hebrewnation.net, theregathering,com and shemaisrael.ing.com. to name a few.  

I very much look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Vicki Radavich

When I returned home from this amazing two week volunteer trip I was completely transformed into a Messianic follower.  Upon returning home, I spent many sleepless nights in study, all the while taking care of my three children as a single mother. I was so hungry for the truth, beauty, life, light, goodness, holiness, and wonder of the Torah! As a mainstream Christian, we were taught that the Torah was made obsolete, but when I was in Israel, I received great and mighty revelation from Yeshua HaMashiach.  I immediately stopped celebrating Christmas, and learned all about Hanukkah and my children celebrated this beautiful holiday instead. We celebrated Purim, and we even celebrated Pesach, and cleansed our home of all leaven and ate only Motzas.  Each and every day my children and I devote time to the prayers of a Messianic Siddur that we have, and each week we remember and honour Shabbat and keep it holy.  I am ever grateful to the Jews because it is they whom HaShem chose as a light unto the nations to reveal to them who G-d is and how to live a life of holiness according to his standards.

Aside from being a wholehearted Messianic follower, I have excellent communication skills and an immense passion to share the Yeshua the Jew to Jewish people around the world. I had the opportunity to minister to a few Jews already, and seeds have been planted. I graduated from Niagara College in the Community and Justice Services Department and in my Writing Strategies course, I received a final grade of 87%, as well, in Communications and Report Writing, I received a final grade of 100%. 

I have an excellent computer with internet access. This is the perfect job for me because I am a single mother of three children, and have chosen to homeschool them so that I can teach them the Torah more in-depth, and I need a job that I can do from home in the evenings so that I may support them. 

You will be hard-pressed to find anyone as dedicated and passionate as I am in wanting to bring the Jews to a knowledge of Yeshua as their Messiah. I am a huge supporter of Israel and the Jewish people, and this job would be an answer to my heartfelt prayers. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. Should you wish to contact me further to discuss any other skills I may have, I may be contacted by email at cpozsonyi@gmail.com, or by phone at 905-468-9366.

Thank you.

To whom it may concern:



This letter is regarding Marna Conway, who managed the office of our Temple as an  administrative assistant for about one year during 2012-2013.  Marna is a valuable asset to have on staff in any corporate setting.  She is a person of character, loyalty, and trustworthiness.  She is experienced and skilled with all aspects of administrative office work, including, but not limited to: contact management, client contact, document preparation, office management, accounting, and communications.  Marna is creative, adapts well to challenging circumstances, follow’s instructions, and can also work on her own with limited Supervision.  I am confident she can manage the affairs of any business office. 



Marna knows most any of the latest office software, and easily adapts to learn and utilize whatever technology is available or given to her.  Marna is a faithful and dedicated worker.  She is not only knowledgeable at what she does, but she has a great attitude, gets along well with other workers, and takes pride in excelling at her work. 



It is my pleasure to recommend Marna Conway for employment at your firm.  Feel free to contact me personally with any questions you may have.

When it comes to the work force, it is vital for me to create, develop, introduce and maintain important skills that pertain to the position I am seeking.  Understanding the fundamentals related to the position I am applying for allows me to focus directly in the areas needed, maximizing my skill level to its fullest and minimizing all unneeded errors. I have a background in counseling, finance and retail management. I have solid customer service and people skills. I find it vital that before any action can be taken, first you have to listen in order to understand the person you are dealing with. Unless you treat each person with full commitment and sincerity, you fail. 
I believe I am qualified for this position based off of my Messianic Jewish background, my passion for YESHUA, my ability to pray with others (I served as a Chaplain’s Assistant in the U.S. Army), my ability to listen and understand, and my genuine desire to apply myself in full to this position with an open heart. I do celebrate all Feasts and honor Shabbat. 
Thank you for your time to this cover letter.

Sincerely,
Paul Flanagan

I am currently working on completing my conversion which I began many years ago. Rabbi Gavriel Moreno-Bryars of Beth Hamashiach in Georgia is mentoring me. I am enrolling to study under Rabbi Richard Nichols at MJTI. While the rabbinical program has not been formally started he has me beginning as a student at large.

I am back in the work force for a year now having worked part time as a delivery truck driver. In the past year I have learned how to operate a fork lift and a pallet jack. I was blessed to have an employers who is also a Messianic Believer. We do not deliver on Saturdays.  I had been out of the work force as a home school educator for over ten years.

I have a bachelors degree in both Medical Technology (medical laboratory) and Perfusion Technology (operating heart/lung machine) yet my references are so old at this point as to be obsolete. While I would be grateful to get back to full time employment in the hospital laboratory, it would present an obstacle to keeping the shabbat weekly. 

I am a socially gregarious person. I have about 2500 friends on facebook. A good number of my friends are Messianic also.  I have enjoyed fund raising in the past especially for something I really believe  in. I have just joined a social network (facebook type app)  just for Messianic Jews called the reGathering.

I think your position in combination with my love of Hashem as a Messianic Jew and the love He has created in me for Hebrew and Israel would be an incredible combination.

Shalom, Dianne Augustine</Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pfAi8gw0</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 4 - Online Training</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">exgNQfwa</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Behnaz Rivkah</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Kamali</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>516 770-7782</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>516 770-7782</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>Behnazbatyeshua@yahoo.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress><ns:PostalAddress><ns:CountryCode>US</ns:CountryCode><ns:PostalCode>11577</ns:PostalCode><ns:Region>NY</ns:Region><ns:Municipality>Roslyn Heights</ns:Municipality><ns:DeliveryAddress><ns:AddressLine>300 Edwards Street APT. 4AE</ns:AddressLine></ns:DeliveryAddress></ns:PostalAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Behnaz Kamali

I became convinced 6+ years ago about the importance of keeping Torah because I love YHWH.  I also believe that Yeheshua will be revealed to my brothers, the Jewish people in YHWH's way and timing so that we will both inhabit the tree of which Yeheshua is the root, according to Romans 11 and Ezekiel 37. I do not believe in "trying to convince the Jewish people of who the Messiah is, by my own efforts but if YHWH wants to use me to "plant seeds" in their heart I would be blessed to be used of Him.  Just as the Jewish people embrace Torah, which is the Word of YHWH, which is Yeshua, on the other side of the coin (the Kingdom) is the Christian community which embrace Yeheshua as Jesus, but not the full and complete Torah.  I do believe that if the Jewish people had accepted the Jesus that the Christian community teaches, they would be breaking the Torah that they embrace by believing on a false prophet, with all the pagan holidays they keep such as Christmas and Easter, as well as the wrong day of the week for keeping the Sabbath.

I have been out of the job market since 1996, when my son was born, as a stay at home parent.  My son is Torah observant.  I currently have a home in Houston, Texas, USA where I provide room and board to foreign language students who are here to learn English.  It is the only job I have and it is not enough to pay the bills since my wife, who was corporately employed, left.  I have been looking for a job where I could have some flexibility with my time so that I could still possibly celebrate Sukkot each year, keep the proper Sabbath, and possibly attend my sons ball games as he is the closest family I have and is a high school standout baseball player in Houston.

I would love to explore the possibility of working in a setting which would serve to further the Kingdom in the truest sense of the Word.  If you are interested in me, I would like to see what arrangements can be made for us to work together.  Thank you for your consideration!</Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pxan8gwX</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Rejected</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">ejMQQfwv</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Mustafah</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Randolph</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>407-431-1869</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>407-431-1869</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>mustafah_q@yahoo.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Mustafah Randolph

Dear Ms. Rozenstein, 
 
    My name is Brian Newman and I am a Torah following believer in Yeshua who has been seeking a full-time position with a ministry or a work from home position for several years. My ministry (Torah of Yeshua Teaching Ministry) focuses on introducing Christians that are new to Torah the basics of Hebrew Roots and also on connecting them with other believers and with other resources so that they may be fully equipped, such as the excellent resource that you and your team are providing. I will also soon be assisting a new ministry called Word of Grace by teaching Hebraic Roots classes and by coordinating Jewish Outreach in the community.
   
   I believe that part of what would make me an asset to your team is my education, which includes a B.A. in History that has provided me with a lot of insight that others do not have concerning the cultural/historical background into the Scriptures and also into Judaism, a B.A. in German (though my German is terrible at the moment) which allowed me to live in Germany so that I could experience other cultures, my M.A. in Human Services with an emphasis in Marriage and Family Counseling that has sharply honed my communication skills, and my current degree program in Theological Studies which has provided me  perspective as well that will serve in reaching out to both communities. 

    My life experience of being a Torah follower for the past 5 years and a Sabbath keeper for years before I discovered Hebrew Roots and Torah as well as teaching Hebrew Roots through Facebook and other venues, growing up in a Baptist Church, and having lived overseas both as a civilian and in the military also gives me a unique perspective that allows me to interact with potential donors.  Additionally, the time that I served in the military has provided me with a larger worldview, great organizational skills, and a strong commitment to whatever I set myself to accomplishing. Future goals that I have include becoming a traveling Torah Teacher and published author of Hebrew Roots materials that bring both Jew and Gentile closer to Yeshua, the Messiah of Israel, as well as becoming a traveling Hebraic Roots Teacher. 
   
   The most important thing that you should know is that Teaching Hebrew Roots and supporting those who do is the calling upon my life, it is the mission that was given me and I have waited for the opportunity to be engaged in full-time Hebrew Roots/Torah Ministry for several years. 
   
The enclosed resume will further describe my qualifications. I look forward to possibly interviewing with you soon.
Sincerely, 

Brian N. Newman

I am a Christian and I have a passion for God and Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.</ns:TextResume></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"><Field type="Candidate" name="Candidate Cover Letter">Dear Ms. Rozenstein,

I have the honor to apply for a position as demed appropriate in the Messianic Prophecy Bible Project.
I am a Chrstian beleiver of the fact that Jesus the Son of God is a Jew and gave His life in the Cross for Humanity's sake.
I have a passion for the Jewish people. I watch Sid Roth's Messianic TV Ministry - It's Supernatural, and have supported his project of dissemination of the good news of Jesus the Messiah to unsaved Jews through the purchase of his book: They thought for themselves.
I have worked for an international Organization while in Mozambique where I basically interacted with different people and conducted phone calls and shedulled appointments. I am hoping that such exposure could be helpful for a project that requires working by phone.
I am not Jewish and I do not observe the holidays, however, I do have access to the IFCJ (Int'l Fellowship of Christians and Jews) website and trust that Rabbi Y. Eckstein has a variety of information that can be useful should I need to familiarize myself about the culture. 
I am unemployed and should I be considered, it would be a womderful opportunity of growth in my faith.

I am looking forward to your further inputs.

Todah rabah and Shalom.

Madalena

HOWEVER I LOVE MY PEOPLE AND I WISH TO WORK WITH YOU BRINGING THE TRUE WORD OF Y'SHUA HOME. PLEASE CHECK MY WEBSITES OUT ON FACEBOOK AND YOU TUBE: "JC THE LION JUDAH" AND WWW.REVERBNATION.COM/JESUSCHRISTTHELIONOFJUDAHMINISTRIES

PLEASE CONTACT ME SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU FOR THE GLORY OF THE KING Y'SHUA HA'MOSHIACH. 

MOST CHRISTIAN GENTILES ARE ISRA'EL'S BEST FRIENDS. 

SHALOM.

Thank you again for calling me back on the phone today and speaking with me about the position of Messianic Communicator.  

As you noticed during our conversation today I'm pretty passionate about our faith, and love communicating with others how Yeshua is the promised Messiah of Israel and the Jewish people worldwide.  He is also the Messiah by which The Father would reconcile all mankind unto Himself.  

I completely agree and support the need for the Messianic Prophecy Bible Project and understand the importance of its completion and worldwide distribution.  And as I shared with you already I've been waiting for HaShem to fulfill a calling on my life involving international Messianic ministry for several years now, and believe this could very well be the fulfillment of that vision and calling.  As for the administrative and communication qualifications for the position, I am bilingual and fluent in Spanish if that helps, very organized and detailed oriented, great at keeping records, and pretty thorough in all things since I believe everything should be done as unto The Lord as it is written.  
I also have High Speed internet and ample space to work in with a designated home office.  

I look forward to hearing from you again and completing a telephone interview in order to share more of my qualifications for this position.  I really believe I'm a great candidate for this position and believe the total peace I have about it stems from the prayers I've been sending up about it.  

Again thank you and many blessings to you.

Sincerely,

Carl </Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pzVL8gw8</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 1 - Questionnaire</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eBD9RfwY</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>patricia</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>lloyd</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>7728288381</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>7728288381</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>jesusluvspat@hotmail.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress><ns:PostalAddress><ns:CountryCode>US</ns:CountryCode><ns:PostalCode>34950</ns:PostalCode><ns:Region>FL</ns:Region><ns:Municipality>Fort Pierce</ns:Municipality><ns:DeliveryAddress><ns:AddressLine>311 N. 18th CT.</ns:AddressLine></ns:DeliveryAddress></ns:PostalAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Patricia Lloyd

First and foremost is my faith in Yeshua and my desire to share Him with all those who are willing to receive Him.

I am currently part of the Carmel Congregation in Haifa, Israel. Through my work on our media team, I have seen the message going out from Zion to the ends of the earth. I have met people and read their e-mails about how the messages and videos have impacted them. It brings me joy to hear that people are being reached and touched through media and the internet.</Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">pQ6N8gwC</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 4 - Online Training</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>BFIWebsite</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eMjbRfwR</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>JANICE K.</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>CRAMER</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>(727) 481-6381</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>(727) 481-6381</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>FllwURdreams2@aol.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress><ns:PostalAddress><ns:CountryCode>US</ns:CountryCode><ns:PostalCode>33774</ns:PostalCode><ns:Region/><ns:Municipality>Indian Rocks Beach</ns:Municipality><ns:DeliveryAddress><ns:AddressLine>33774

RE:  Telephone Communicator

Dear Rachel Rozenstein, 

I’m the right person for this position because I enjoy talking to people about the great God we serve.  I am very good at fundraising and I enjoy assisting customers with the full order process, asking and answering questions to make the deal.  I really enjoy matching solutions to problems for people and following up to make sure things are working out well. 

My personality is upbeat and I enjoy a fast paced environment.  My background has put me in a few high-pressure positions, dealing with people from all walks of life. I learned a very simple formula for success: listen a lot and talk a little. It has been very useful in dealing with customer service issues. When problems do arise, they only get worse when a customer doesn't feel that anyone is willing to listen. I've found I am comfortable interacting with people from aerospace, oil companies, unions, labor boards, sales people, military officers, dealing with security issues and employee problems. I have excellent communication skills and I would thoroughly enjoy working in a diverse position. 

I have previous customer service experience and thorough working knowledge Microsoft Office Suite, as I’ve used all versions. I have over ten (10) years of office experience which includes data entry, shipment tracking, order processing support, marketing assistance, receptionist duties, filing, copying, office supplies coordination, records management, as well as other office related duties. I am proficient in using printers, copiers, scanners, faxes, calculators and multi-line phone systems; solving problems related to software setup errors, developing spreadsheets and creating easy to use reports.  I have updated chart of accounts, posted AR, AP, balance sheets, P&amp;L statements, bank reconciliation, and payroll.  

I’d like to thank you taking my application and ask that you’d please consider me for your open position.  I'm very grateful for the opportunity to discuss this position and to do what ever I can to extend the boundaries of His kingdom. I look forward to examining my background and learning more about your needs to see if we've found a possible match.

Sincerely, 


Wanda Rae Samuelson

I began seeing and understanding the importance of the Covenant made with Israel and how we show our love to Yeshua by keeping His Commandments. I began to apply for Universities to get a broader education and apply for Chaplaincy in the Air Force only to discover the current National Accredited Schools do not teach on keeping Torah. I have attended Liberty University Online just to fill the degree requirement, but I plan to pursue higher learning after my enlistment is finished with the military.

Since I began teaching I have traveled to over 10 different countries teaching and explaining the Jewish/Hebrew Roots of the bible. Currently I am a local Pastor/Teacher of a congregation "Asef Chavar" in New Mexico who has taught others how to understand and keep the Holy Feasts. I am highly motivated, self organized, gifted in teaching and explaining biblical principles in a very easy to understand way. I have  a clear speaking voice and will be able to effectively speak on behalf of your organization.

As of right now I can only commit to this position part time due to being Active Duty Air Force, attending University, and Pastoral duties with the congregation. As I transition out of the military I will be looking for opportunity to be more involved in ministries.

Over my past years i have had to coordinate with multiple government agencies with the highest standards and responsibilities to complete our missions. I will be able to use my Leadership and Management experience to further your organization.

God Bless Rachel Rozenstein ,

I would like to express my interest in the Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers position. In joining your ministry, you find I am dedicate and produce individual. What I may lack in experience is well made up for my ability to interact with the public and a common sense approach to dealing with people. I speak and understand well English/Spanish. 
As you know my name is Roberto Velez Jr. My birth place is in Puerto Rico but my heart has always been in Israel. My family came from a Catholic belief til my uncle introduce my mom to Jesus. I was raise in a church but unfortunately I did not have the relationship, it was just tradition. Even though my step father introduce me in my teenage years to mail course bible study-The Prisoner's Web ministry. I grew in knowledge of the Word. After high school and during my early 20's, my relationship with the Lord turn lukewarm. Till 3 years ago in 2010, because of an evangelize brother in TV, my soul was convict and challenge my faith. I ask God to restore me, my life and bring me back to Him. Thanks to a college ministry and which I still labor with (changeyourcampus.com) I became faithful to God and His will. I started to have a faithful relationship and grow in God. To imagine I never even thought of evangelize but God had different plan and purpose in my life. That is what I do. I work weekdays and weekends work for God. The overseer of the college ministry is also my pastor. Also thanks to your ministry-biblesforIsrael.com and chosenpeople.com and yes my messiah Yeshua led me to my roots to learn Judaism and Israel history. I love to study His Word and share the Gospel and witness. Also, I started going every Friday to a Messianic Congregation in Wayne NJ-Beth Israel Rabbi Jonathan Cahn. Like a second home but I learn soo much of Judaism and the Bible come to life as I study deep into God's Word and how Yeshua is reveal in the Old Testament. Last year into 2013 are my first time celebrate Jewish Feastivals and I love it, especially Passover. Thank You Jesus, you are the Lamb of God. Praise His Holy name, Glory belongs to our father God.
 It is my desire to work for a bless ministry and grow with you guys my family in Yeshua. A ministry whose passion as my to bridge our jewish people and arabic, the whole world to Mashiach Yeshua-Jesus the Messiah. By faith the Bible and the work your ministry are doing will reach not just many jewish people but more then we can imagine. Thank You for your time in looking at my application and resume. Feel free any question call or email. Have a Bless week and looking forward to labor and bring the Kingdom of God to earth and to His home Israel with you and your staff. Be strong in the Lord.


Sincerely,

Roberto Velez Jr

Please excuse my resume it has not been updated for a while. I have been working for Subway since last November. My favorite part of the job is interacting with the customers.

August 1991-May 1995</ns:TextResume></ns:NonXMLResume></ns:Resume><ns:UserArea><CustomFields xmlns="http://api.jobvite.com/action/api/v1"><Field type="Candidate" name="Candidate Cover Letter">As a pastor and a son of a missionary pastor, I have been involved with ministry all my life. From a young age till now, the call of the Father on my life has never waned. My wife and I have always sought God’s leading in our decisions and the need to bring our thoughts and plans before Him. This focus on His plan for us has led us to many wonderful experiences and opportunities. We have gone through the process of becoming missionaries to France; however, God closed the door. For three years we helped start a mission ministry to the Navajo people. I have worked with youth, children’s ministries, Adult Bible Fellowships, on the Church board as the Missions/Evangelism Chairperson, and most recently as a pastor. I share these to show my desire to see lives change through the message of Yeshua and His kingdom. We have also realized in our lives the essential need of prayer and going before the Father both to praise Him and bring our petitions before Him. He has never failed us but often providentially worked to show His hand in our family. His providence can also be seen in the secular positions I have held. He has used them to hone my skills in administration, counseling, computers and technology, and the ability to communicate with a wide range of people.

I resigned my position as a Baptist pastor in January as part of my conviction that the whole counsel of God is needed for “life and godliness” and that the Torah is the foundation of our understanding of His Word. My family and I are currently attending Beth Immanuel Sabbath Fellowship in Hudson, Wisconsin, in order to grow further in our understanding of the Hebrew culture and to be involved in furthering the understanding of Messianic teachings. I am excited and blessed to be a part of what God is doing to grow His kingdom. 
As part of my childhood I was always taught a passion for the spiritual needs Jewish people. The congregations I have belonged to have always strongly supported the nation of Israel and the Jewish people scattered throughout the world. With a dual major in both History and Bible, I develop an appreciation for the history of God’s people and the great need for Yeshua to be shared with them. Because of the multitude of experiences the Father has given me, in dealing with both Messianics and Christians, I believe He has gifted me with the ability to clearly communicate His Word and Kingdom to Jews, Messianics, and Christians alike.

Most recently, my wife and I have been blessed with furthering our knowledge of computers in starting a web development and Messianic online publishing company. I have had extensive knowledge with computers including all Microsoft Office software, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, and various other graphic, audio and database programs. While I was in college I worked at General Electric Information Systems, where our team called all General Electric companies, verifying their capital assets and entering them into General Electric’s database software. Our team finished ahead of schedule and was noticed for our exemplary work. This is just one example of many experiences where God has honed my ability to talk with people both in person and on the phone. This is another reason why I believe I am the right person for this position.

Most important is my passion for the Word of God to go forward. I have a passion to see lives changed through the power of God's Word and to see His kingdom furthered. If this is what the Messianic Prophecy Bible Project is about, then I would be honored to serve in seeing its vision go forward.

I am 56 & have been a seeker of truth most of my life, from a non practicing Jewish family of Russian heritage.  I gave my life to the Lord 9 years ago at a pentacostal church in Pa. I have since discovered my real Jewish roots through Gods word & Bible study.  I am also a Sunday school teacher & manage a free community clothes closet on site.    Our Pastor is passionate about the Tabernacle & the church purchased museum quality replicas of the furnishings which are a sight to behold as well as teaching tools.  We also had a resident Messianic Rabbi on site for a few years doing on going teachings.  
   Recently I led a community Passover Seder for 60 people at our church which was a blessing to be able to share the Hebraic roots of the Church.  As the Lord commands us to keep His feasts for all generations!  I feel passionate about Jewish people to have the spiritual blindness removed & to finally know the joy of their own Messiah &  the hope of His salvation!  
As we know, we are to provoke the Jews to jealosy before His long awaited return.  I truly believe that we are in the end times & should feel a sense of urgency to be the Light that we are called to be.  
     I have always felt a call to Jewish ministry but unsure what direction to take.  I have a private cleaning business which helps pay bills but is not my calling. : (  I visit Beth Israel Worship Center in NJ as often as possible as it is 2 hrs away.  It would truly be my home church if it was closer as I believe it is an End TIme Center for the Harvest of souls.  Rabbi Jonathan Cahn is an anointed vessel in the Lords kingdom!   Just as I was leaving I picked up the last paper for your Work From home ad & felt a tingle of delight that this was what I was praying for.  To be able to do Kingdom Work for the salvation of Gods chosen people!  I almost couldnt sleep at the possibility getting paid to work for the Lord in such a powerful way to reach the multitudes with His Word!  Reading the description & hours all feel like the perfect fit to be in His will & purpose being a Born Again Jew.  
     Thankyou for the possibility to serve Him in such a powerful way!      
                                                                      In His Service, Robin

I have been involved in the Messianic movement for the past 16 years.   When I saw your ad for an editorial assistant I was excited that there was a potential opportunity to serve Messiah in a Bible project.  Much of my work in offices involved editorial assistance.  I believe I have the skills and passion necessary to do this job and a work from home job would be ideal for my situation.

I recently saw an interview with an Orthodox Jewish man in Israel who wants to put Y'shua on trial in a rabbinic court to prove that He is the Messiah.  This man believes he can do this.  This signals to me that the time is ripe for a project like this.   The ground is becoming softer to receive the message of Messiah Y'shua.

I sincerely hope to hear from you and would look forward to being part of a team to spread Messiah's message of deliverance to those who have ears to hear.

Kind regards,

Steve (aka Tzefanyah) Pappas

Rachel Rozenstein
The Messianic Jewish Bible Society, Bibles for Israel

Ms. Rozenstein,


I heard about this job position from my Pastor Peder Olsen at the Light House, Messianic congregation.  Given my experiences and capabilities I would appreciate your consideration for this job opening.  I believe that my skill sets and previous experiences make me a good fit for this position.

I believe I am the right fit, because I love the Jewish people and their culture, and pray for them regularly.  My extensive ministry experience qualifies me, because I have a background in interacting with people of diverse cultures.  I have knowledge and understanding in working with computers and can easily be trained in new software.  I also have phone and customer service skills from previous employment.  My experience in the Bible dates back to my childhood, and I have been in ministry most of my life.

Thank you for taking the time to review my credentials and experience.

Sincerely,

Jherysa Peterson

     Could you please consider me for the position of Telemarketer for Bibles for Israel?   

     I am an outgoing person and I can articulate a product or service well to prospects.

I am a christian believer and atend church regularly and I gain a great benefit by obtaining guidance for the Word of God for my life and I can recommend the Bible as a good resource for living one's life.   The Bible says:  "the fool hath said in his heart there is no God."  and in Psalm 119:  Thy law is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path."

Although my resume does not exactly indicate it, my passion in life is loving and serving my Creator and heavenly Father, His son Yeshua, devouring His Word, and communicating that love and passion in various ways to those around me.  I have done this over the past fifteen years through writing, speaking/teaching and serving on various worship teams, leadership boards, and pastoral staffs. On Father's Day 2001, God poured out revelation into my life and opened my eyes to the unbelievably awesome truth about my Hebraic roots.  He subsequently called me to step out of church leadership and out of the Christian church proper for a season so He could cultivate my belief, obedience, and understanding of my Biblical Jewish heritage of faith.  In the past few years I have been developing relationships with both Messianic believers and those in the Christian church.  I believe God has called me to be a bridge-builder between the two.  My passion now is writing and teaching both Christian and Messianic believers alike about their rich heritage in Jewish faith and culture, and their amazing, God-given inheritance in Christ (Yeshua), among other things.

Earlier this year, in February, I heard the Lord distinctly calling me out of my eleven-year career with Starbucks Coffee Company and into the unknown, with no back-up job as a safety net.  Since then I have been going deeper and further in my walk with the Lord, waiting on Him to open whatever door He wished.  I believe the time is ripe for me to do work connected to ministry, teaching truth and the spreading of the gospel, particularly as it concerns understanding our Hebraic roots and seeing Yeshua (Christ) and the Bible from a Jewish perspective.  

When a friend sent me this job description, something clicked in my spirit, and it seemed a very good opportunity for me, and for you, as I am someone who can and will effectively and passionately communicate the truth about Yeshua and all the wonderful benefits of the Messianic Bible.  In addition, I meet every single requirement listed.  I am extremely, 100% passionate about my savior and Messiah, Yeshua, I live alone in a quiet apartment and could work in privacy any time of day, I use a fully loaded Macbook and have an outstanding internet connection, I have better-than-average computer skills learned from extensive past experience, I am detail-oriented and organized, have a deep desire to continue learning more and more about Yeshua and Israel, have been keeping Shabbat and the biblical feasts since 2001, and have a habitual routine of starting each day in prayer, in worship, and in the Word.  I cannot function without it.  I also have four years' experience as a volunteer answering phones and praying with callers during CBN (Christian Broadcasting Network) telethons from 1998-2002, so I am very comfortable doing that.  In fact, it excites me.  

I'm sure there are many other qualified candidates out there applying for this job, and I know that God will select the right people to carry out this mission.  But I also know that, God willing, I can and will be a very good fit for this role.  

Thank you for your consideration.

Blessings and shalom,
Jeff Calhoun

STRENGTHS OVERVIEW
Strong closer/negotiator: 60% + success rate in commission-only sales in the Mortgage/Real Estate industry
Exceptional presentation skills: I have represented the Northwest’s most powerful brands as a spokesperson in corporate videos and/or print ads, including but not limited to:  Starbucks, Microsoft, Boeing.
Entrepreneurial and self-motivated leader: Most of my career has been in highly competitive industries that have required a high degree of adaptability, discipline, and creativity.
Committed to excellence: As a professional driving instructor I have consistently earned the highest review scores out of all of my colleagues.  
Strong interpersonal and team-building skills: Whether dealing with clients or peers, professionals or high school students, I understand how to build trusted relationships and strong, committed teams. 
Quick, flexible learner: My career history, while varied, demonstrates an ability to rapidly learn, grow, and contribute to a company.  
Dependable and committed to your success: As one who owned my own company, I understand the demands of running a business. 


EMPLOYMENT HISTORY:

SWERVE DRIVING SCHOOL:  Professional Driving Instructor     Current

Parents have entrusted me with the lives of their children. It is a responsibility that I have honored by teaching their sons and daughters in a way that is engaging, concise, and clear, both “in-car” and in the classroom. 
I provide a high level of excellence and service to an audience that can be difficult: teenagers. My instruction to them has been unambiguous, organized, and compelling. And the students have responded by giving me the highest scores of all Swerve instructors. 
Dealing with individuals from diverse backgrounds (ranging from teenagers to adults) has enabled me to hone even further my abilities as a presenter/teacher, trusted advisor, quick learner, and self-starter. In the process, I have communicated the elements of success to new drivers and given them confidence. 
Additionally, through my network of professional contacts, I have provided supplementary sales to the company and have added to their continued success. 




THRIVE COMMUNITY FITNESS:  General Manager/Franchisee July 2008-July 2009

As General Manager of a Community Fitness Center, I was responsible for building clientele and providing exemplary customer service to all members.  I provided a dynamic atmosphere where employees and members were enabled to reach their goals. 
I was responsible for tight deadlines in daily bookkeeping, payroll, advertising, marketing, scheduling employees, vendor management. This was all accomplished with clear communication of guidelines to staff.  
I utilized my strength in business-to-business sales to incorporate other community business partnerships. Under my management, personal training sales were increased  as I focused my abilities and background in professional sales to increase customer retention.  
The management position demanded attention to detail, clear communications, and enforcement of company guidelines to ensure a clean, vibrant facility, the safety/health of staff and members, and to create a positive brand experience. 
As a team builder, I motivated staff and management to grow our business successfully.  This required the ability to multitask proficiently, maintain a high degree of professionalism with the end result of satisfying members and meeting their expectations. 


TOBIN FINANCIAL SERVICES: Owner/President                          1996-2008

As Owner/President of a sole proprietorship, my mortgage/real estate firm provided exemplary service to customers seeking residential home mortgage financing. I was responsible for all aspects of the company, from the ground up. At the highest level, this included providing contract loan processing services, consulting services, and mobile notary services. 
To ensure growth, I developed a marketing strategy to build our customer database through relational sales and exceptional service that resulted in word-of-mouth clients. 
I built strong relationships with customers, real estate agents, and loan processors to ensure state compliance and that proper diligence was provided to each customer. 
Further business-to-business marketing efforts included setting up mobile notary accounts for escrow companies. This enhanced business relationships by providing off-site mortgage financing notary signings
There are countless laws and state regulations in the mortgage industry. As a start up mortgage company responsible for state licensing and bookkeeping, attention to detail and the ability to communicate effectively to all parties was crucial and achieved. 
The purchase of a home can be a stressful situation and is fraught with conflict. I used my negotiation and interpersonal skills to resolve disagreements and keep the process moving forward.   
The result of our efforts was satisfied customers at all ends of the spectrum — from loan officers to realtors to borrowers. Our excellence was recognized by smaller mortgage companies who hired me to train their salespeople, help them expand their network marketing, and increase their loan performance and customer retention. 


ACTOR/SPOKESMAN                           1999-Present

I have been a successful professional actor and company spokesperson for 12 years, performing in television, independent films, commercials, video, and print work. As a hiring manager, you may wonder: “what can an actor bring to my company?” More than you might imagine. 

Acting is a highly competitive field. It requires the ability to withstand rejection and keep moving forward with optimism. As an employee, I will not give up when things get difficult. 
Acting requires the ability to “get into the head” of someone else; to understand their needs and desires. As your employee, I can place myself in the shoes of a boss, co-worker, or customer and see a problem from his or her point of view.
Acting requires self-motivation and the ability to move forward even in the midst of ambiguity. As your employee, I will not need continuous instruction but can move forward on my own and discovering the answers as I go.   
Acting requires the ability to take direction. As your employee I will be open to learn from you and others without any defensiveness. 
Acting requires the ability to collaborate with others. As your employee, I will become an integral part of a team and provide ideas to improve our performance. 
Acting requires the ability to adapt. As your employee, I will understand that each project may require a different role. Acting has given me the ability to adapt to any role that is put before me. 
As a professional actor I have taken a leadership role in my community and enjoyed the opportunity to speak before the State House of Representatives regarding the industry and to be a mentor to others starting their own acting career.

A year ago I found out through family lineage that I am Jewish. Finding this out was better than winning the lottery; every hole and longing in my faith walk with God suddenly became filled. As partners with Jewish Voice Ministries, we got connected with a Messianic congregation in Phoenix, Arizona [we were living in Tennessee at the time]. We moved to Phoenix, believing that God was calling us to begin discovering our Jewish roots and serving the Jewish community as well as the Gentile community [becoming One New Man, Ephesians 2:14-22]. We arrived here nine months ago with nothing in our pockets, all of our belongings packed into our old, tiny truck, and hearts filled with faith. God has blessed us tremendously since obeying His calling to do this. I enrolled in Beth Yachad Messianic Yeshiva and completed 2 courses in Hebrew and Bible History 101/102. I have a deep passion for learning my Hebrew roots, and I love celebrating the appointed times and seasons [festivals, holidays like Pesach, Shavout etc.]. I am a well spoken individual and do well speaking with people over the telephone and internet. I have been looking for an at home job so I can raise my two-year-old more intimately, and I believe I would do well in a job like this. As a matter of fact, it almost sounds too good to be true. But I know how good Adonai is. </Field></CustomFields></ns:UserArea></ns:Candidate><ns:Candidate xmlns:ns="http://ns.hr-xml.org/2007-04-15"><ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="applicationId">p1zZ9gwt</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Status>Step 2 Pre-interview Recording</ns:Status></ns:CandidateRecordInfo><ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:PositionPosting><ns:Id idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="requisitionId">TM02</ns:IdValue></ns:Id><ns:Title>Messianic Telephone Communicators-Fundraising Representatives &amp; Managers</ns:Title></ns:PositionPosting></ns:RelatedPositionPostings><ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:SupplierId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="sourcedBy">snV9Vfw6</ns:IdValue></ns:SupplierId><ns:EntityName>Google_Plus</ns:EntityName><ns:SourceType><ns:NonStandardValue>Job Board</ns:NonStandardValue></ns:SourceType></ns:CandidateSupplier><ns:CandidateProfile><ns:PersonalData><ns:PersonId idOwner="Jobvite"><ns:IdValue name="candidateId">eZa7RfwR</ns:IdValue></ns:PersonId><ns:PersonName><ns:GivenName>Chad</ns:GivenName><ns:FamilyName>Frith</ns:FamilyName></ns:PersonName><ns:ContactMethod><ns:Use>personal</ns:Use><ns:Location>home</ns:Location><ns:Telephone><ns:FormattedNumber>5022902789</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Telephone><ns:Mobile><ns:FormattedNumber>5023562031</ns:FormattedNumber></ns:Mobile><ns:InternetEmailAddress>cfrith@insightbb.com</ns:InternetEmailAddress></ns:ContactMethod></ns:PersonalData></ns:CandidateProfile><ns:Resume><ns:NonXMLResume><ns:TextResume>Chad T Frith 502-356-2031

Having confessed with my mouth and believing in my heart that Jesus Christ is LORD, I have spent many years in prophetic biblical study with emphasis on the festival cycle of Ysrael as it relates to the death, burial, ressurection of the LORD and Saviour Jesus Christ, the birth and translation of the Church, and the soon return of Jesus with the establishment of His reign on the throne of David in Jerusalem.

 Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this position.   I have been a believer for a little over 20 years.  I came to the knowledge of  following Torah about 1.5 years ago.  It is my  passion to follow Yeshua my Messiah in all that I do.
I Continue to study about the Hebrew roots of my faith, and Israel. This includes learning and celebrating YHWH's feast days.  This would include the minor feast days Purim and Hanukkah I strive to spend about 30 minutes in prayer and 30 minutes in Scripture everyday.  As well as prayer and devotions with the family. 

I have a home studio for my internet radio station that is separate from the house in which I can work from.  This room is equipped with  2 Pc's. One for broadcasting and one for music production and other studio work. 
 I currently have a FIOS internet connection which allows me to broadcast, surf the net,  and my family can stream media inside the house without any interruption.


Thank you in advance for reviewing my resume and considering me for employment.

Blessings to you,  Scott Bell

I have such a strong desire for them to know and see Y'shua as the one and ONLY promised Messiah in the OT.  I have been in prayer about having an avenue to reach out some way for a lonnng time and feel GOD/Ha Shem is answering my prayers Praise his Holy name forever!  

As far as qualified, yes very much so. I have  8+ years experience in this particular type of work environment (telecommunications), as I managed setting up our customer base for the company I use to work for :) Alarm Tech. 
.
I feel I would be an asset for this position not only because of my experience but also I am mature and detail oriented..I am actually so excited!  I am very well versed with the internet, assorted apps such as word, excel, skype etc. I am familiar with e-mail, making folders etc excellent phone skills as well. I am a woman of integrity and excellence, after all we serve an Excellent GOD!

I do have high speed internet, and I am alone in my home so my work area is very quiet, which is my preference, as when I have my prayer time and study time, that's a must, no exceptions..I have a special area for my  work area, with no problem at all.

I hope I have answered this as you would expect, I also hope I didnt forget anything  :)...I wanted to get this done before Sabbath begins. I look soo forward to the Sabbath and the Feasts of the LORD!  Oh how blessed I feel right now...Ha Shem has smiled on me and heard my cries! You have no idea my friends. 

I truly look very forward to hearing from you and thank you for this blessed opportunity, even if you should decide not to hire me...

I thank you Mishpocah!

Shabbat Shalom to you all should I not hear back until after Sabbath!

In Y'shua,
